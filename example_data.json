THE GAME -**~~ (Please consider playing PostCompo version) https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9e_ZRFruqXvSVdZT0dkSkIzZEE\nit's Java so it 'should' be cross-platform, although I think cross-platform Java sound is a bit sketchy. It will work fine on windows (with a bit of luck)\n\n**2. THE SOURCE -** https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9e_ZRFruqXvMkRHZGlpQ3ExNG8\nSo... I heard people learn stuff from LD sources. Feel free. But.... Um.. It's a 'bit' of a ~~clusterf~~ mess\n\n**POST COMPO - ** This is some VERY MINOR bugfixes. There are ways in the original you can easily cheat, and win for free, I would much appreciate it if you played the post compo, and judged it as though it was the original, the original is left above for comparison reasons, Thanks!\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9e_ZRFruqXvbGg5aUU1RkRMUG8 - this is the **post compo link**\n\n\n**README - INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n**Running-----**\n\nMake sure you run \"TheAliens.jar\" in the same folder as the sounds directory\n\n**Concept-----**\n\nYou play as a space rocket, that can shoot Aliens, and you have to get as high as possible.\nYou can upgrade your space rocket, with coins that the Aliens drop when you kill them.\nYou can then get higher.\n\nYou 'win' the game at level 7, although you can continue playing if you wanna see how high you can get ;)\n\n**Designing----**\n\nWhen you start the game it will be in the \"Design\" tab (top left)\nthis is where you upgrade your space rocket the buttons labeled \"Nose Cones\", \"Bodies\" etc. control which part of the\nship you are trying to upgrade, e.g. if you wanted to upgrade the thruster, you would click on \"Main Thrusters\"\n\nTo upgrade a part, just click on one of the buttons underneath the green label that will be labelled similarly/thesame as the button\nyou clicked.\n\nWhen you start you won't be able to afford anything, so click on the play tab (topleft)\n\n**Playing---**\n\nYou will see your ship. When you are ready, click on LAUNCH. This will start the ship, and it will take off (very slowly if you have the\nfirst thruster). Before you do so though, there will be an alien that will come out on the screen pretty soon.\nThe very start can quite often be quite narly, just spam the shoot button (SPACEBAR), and kill the first enemy, after that it will be\nslightly easier.\n\nWhenever you kill an enemy he drops coins for you to collect.\nYou can see your current height, level, money, and nextgoal(how far you need to go before getting to the next level)\n\n**About-----**\n\nMy name is Ned Boulter. I make games from scratch for almost every Ludum Dare\nI very much enjoy it. Usually I make 3D games, because it hides my programmer art more.\nI am 17 at time of writing, but my age is always 20xx where xx = myage. i.e: 2017: 17\n\nI am very interested in graphics programming (e.g. OpenGL, Vulkan)\nI am currently learning vulkan.\n\n**FAQ----**\n\nDo you really think this fits the theme?\n\tI am aware the game doesn't really fit the theme, it was supposed to be as the ship got further away from the \n        planet,\n\tthe planet got smaller (which is very tacked on) but it sounded good in my head.\n\n\nYou know you can turn the ship 180 degrees, and go into negative height?\n\tIs this fun? Yes! Well, while it's fun you go ahead and do that, but when it get's boring (and it will)\n\tyou can play the game properly :P", "love": 0, "name": "The Aliens", "parent": 9405, "author": 766, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T20:37:10Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T19:46:59Z", "slug": "the-aliens", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 66590, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T03:07:23Z", "link": {"author": [766]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/the-aliens", "type": "item", "id": 15225}

But be quick because there's other aliens who want to beat you to it. And literally put up stones in your path. And fight you. Sometimes with muskets.\n\nI'm going to be seriously upset at all the bugs that no doubt are inevitably still in this. Oh well, here's my submission. That'll teach me for making a deep strategy / board / card game all in one haha! Once you get used to the rules it's pretty intuitive and fun though!\n\nVoting Category Opt-outs: None.

You can move around by dragging it.\n* You are represented by a little token/counter of a spaceship. The spaceship must always be on a planet - you can move your ship to other planets by dragging it.\n* The game proceeds in turns - each action = 1 turn. Other players can do the same thing too.\n* Orange planets allow you to mine resources. There are three resources in the top-left of the display.\n* Green planets allow you to purchase cards. Each game has the same deck of cards, which are shuffled and distributed to the trader planets. Each trading post has 5 cards, until the deck runs out.\n* Green cards you purchase go into your hand / card pile. There's a button to see that on the top-right. They help you gather more resources.\n* Orange cards go into your hanger. They're tools like weapons you can use to do stuff like blow up the earth. Again, button to see them is on the top-right.\n* To activate an orange card, open your hanger and click on the card.\n* If you move onto a planet with another player, a battle occurs. Note others can also initiate battle with you! In a battle, each player discards one weapon. The player who discarded the weaker weapon loses (if it's a tie, you still lose).\n* If you lose a battle you lose all your orange cards and your unspent resources reset to your starting resources, plus you skip a turn and are sent to your home planet (the one you start on).\n* If you are attacked on your home planet, and you lose, you lose the game.\n* If you move onto the Earth too much, humans might start to notice you. If you're discovered, Earth may trigger a countdown timer giving you only 150 moves to complete the game.", "love": 0, "name": "Conquer Earth", "parent": 9405, "author": 10164, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T20:38:23Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T03:01:40Z", "slug": "conquer-earth-1", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67518, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T01:02:38Z", "link": {"author": [10164]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/conquer-earth-1", "type": "item", "id": 15238}

You will rally any nearby npc villagers from your tribe to assist you in your attack.\n- !defend - focus on defense! Will mostly idle, but will ignore other tasks like expansion and act against aggressors from a further radius and with increased strength.\n- !retreat - very useful! Run back to your villager's \"home\". Will slowly heal once they have returned if left to idle.\n\n\n## Links & Source\n\nDue to its nature there's not really much point me uploading the game for you to play.

{"body": "You are a hugely unpopular president.  You are also a giant, for some reason.  In order to raise your popularity, you have decided to use your status as a giant to stomp around and squash out the resistance.  Literally.\n\nThis is a Goat Simulator style \"Smash-Em-Up\" where you get points for causing chaos.  Unlike Goat Sim, you can be defeated.  You can destroy stuff, obviously just by ramming into it at high speeds, being a giant with a high mass.  You also have Abilities (think Overwatch) that can do other things, such as blasting down stuff in front of you, or disabling all the things nearby, like Sombra's EMP.  Do enough damage, and you'll charge your Ultimate ability, and can cause even MORE chaos!  How long can you last, and how much damage can you cause?  Share your high-scores, and I'll keep the top scores up to date here.\n\n(Please remember: This is supposed to be a really derpy satire game.

Unfortunately you're not THAT powerful and you can only create small flat worlds, oh well. Roll up your sleeves, you're about to get your hands dirty.\n\n## The Goal\nYour goal is to use your somewhat powerful abilities to create worlds to certain specifications, be it a planet of cities, a giant swamp or some combination of the possible plots of land you can place.\n\n## The short guide to creating worlds\nI don't need to tell a being with powers how to do their job, but you may want to start by grabbing some land from your scroll of power and placing it onto the bedrock on the planet's empty husk. Sometimes you'll only need to fill a planet up to win, other times you'll need to meet certain quotas in order to create the perfect world (divine bureaucracy, am I right?) . One thing you'll notice right away is that each plot of land will often influence the land it is placed next to. A mountain can be completely eroded by an ocean, and a grassland can be settled in if a river is near.\n\n## Where do I sign up?\nAs someone who wants to have the powers of creation you can sign up at your local power being recruitment center above.\n\nYou can also get the mobile starter pack at the above location (Android only), proper recruitment center pending.\n\n## Final words\nWe recommend trying the game on your Android device, it was our self imposed additional goal to make the game friendly. The current APK will say you need to allow installations from unknown locations (I swear no bad things were added :grinning:). I'll be trying to put it on the play store later to facilitate things.\n\nBelow we've added the possible combinations, for the best experience I recommend discovering them on your own but in the interest of saving people time for rating we'll provide them below.\n\n# :point_down:Spoiler:point_down:\n\n###### :arrow_down:\n###### :arrow_down:\n###### :arrow_down:\n###### :arrow_down:\n\n|              |exists      |exists       |exists    |exists   |exists   |exists  |exists   |exists   |\n|---           |---         |---          |---       |---      |---      |---     |---      |---      |\n|              |**Mountain**|**Grassland**|**Desert**|**River**|**Hills**|**Town**|**Water**|**Swamp**|\n|**+Mountain** |            |River        |Hills     |         |Mountain |        |         |         |\n|**+Grassland**|            |             |          |         |         |        |         |         |\n|**+Desert**   |            |Desert       |          |         |         |Desert  |Swamp    |Grassland|\n|**+River**    |            |Town         |Grassland |Swamp    |Grassland|        |         |River    |\n|**+Hills**    |            |River        |          |         |         |        |         |         |\n|**+Town**     |            |Town         |          |         |         |        |         |Grassland|\n|**+Water**    |Hills       |             |          |Water    |River    |        |         |Water    |\n|**+Swamp**    |            |Swamp        |Grassland |         |         |Swamp   |         |         |", "love": 0, "name": "Bureaucratic Deity Simulator 2018", "parent": 9405, "author": 2167, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T21:01:42Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T23:36:08Z", "slug": "bureaucratic-deity-simulator-2018", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67141, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T21:45:09Z", "link": {"author": [2167, 3017, 22650, 13202]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/bureaucratic-deity-simulator-2018", "type": "item", "id": 15639}

{"body": "![swwCover.jpg](///raw/de6/3/z/25ca.jpg)\n\nSmall world war is a game that takes place in the imagination of a young boy playing with his toys. instead of doing his homework, you play as one of the imaginary toy soldiers fighting off hordes of enemies on a great desk battlefield with a dollhouse-castle \u201cloaned\u201d from your little sister. You get to recruit more toy soldiers to help you defend the castle and install battle-defenses to keep the swathing enemies away. You win if you withstand 20 rounds and lose if every single one of your allies die. After a round has passed you receive loot from which you can purchase upgrades and recruit more allies with.\n\nWe had a blast making this game and are pretty proud of ourselves over what we accomplished on the time we were given. our group consisted of one programmer, two modelers and one idea-guy/moral-support. Every asset except the music and sound effects were created by us during the 72 hours, and we are already really looking forward to the next gamejam!   \n\n______________________________________\n\nTools: Unity 5, Photoshop, Blender, Audacity \n______________________________________\n\nDIRECTIONS: \nAfter pressing the play button you will be presented with an in-game menu, this is where you do your pre-battle upgrades and recruiting. You are given 5 actions points with which you can spend on creating more defenses, upgrading existing defenses or go out looking for loot. On the right side of the screen you can see how much loot you currently have. The buttons have their loot costs right next to them. Buying units don\u2019t cost action points and only show how many you have in reserve (not units currently stationed in their respective battlestations). Soldiers killed in battle will be replaced with the soldiers you have in reserve so it is wise to try and keep a healthy supply of soldiers up.

Kaiju kiddies Princess and Demi romp about this tiny planet, destroying its tiny civilization and trying to beat each other up. But it's all in good fun!\nTwo other buddies were supposed to join in, but they didn't show up? It's almost like making a 3D multiplayer game with four unique playable characters for a game jam is overly ambitious.\n\nCONTROLS:\nPlayer 1: left/right to move left and right, up to jump, down to use special dash ability!\nPlayer 2: left/right to move left and right, up to jump\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\nYour objective is to build up speed, then once you're at the maximum, ram into your opponent to send them into space! Running into small or medium-sized buildings will slow you down, and running into large buildings or your opponent (at less than max speed) will send you tumbling! Finally, jumping allows you to dodge obstacles, get your bearings, and turn at a faster rate, but you'll lose speed.\n\nPLAYER ONE controls Princess, and she has a special ability. Press the down arrow to do a short dash, which increases Princess's speed AND makes her more resilient to collisions.\n\nPLAYER TWO controls Demi. Demi lacks a special ability (she, uh, came down with a virus...), but her speed, acceleration, and turning are all higher! Note that she still needs to reach MAX speed to knock Princess out.\n\nThis game is for TWO PLAYERS ONLY. We know it's less convenient, but if you are hanging out with a friend please remember to give our game a try!

I'd like to mark it down as a proof of concept, and the experience I've gained from it has been highly valuable.\n\nI hope whoever plays fills in the blanks and understands where the scope of the game was headed, so enjoy!\n\n**Gameplay:**\nIn this turn-based strategy game, send your bees into the wild to bring back pollen and create honey for your colony to survive. Keep your bees happy by feeding them well, and providing them with adequate housing, to avoid overcrowding.\n\nHere is a link to the game while the site gets patched up: https://laurenceduffy.itch.io/the-world-of-bees", "love": 0, "name": "The World of Bees", "parent": 9405, "author": 1810, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T21:20:17Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-23T22:59:43Z", "slug": "the-world-of-bees", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 40366, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 1, "published": "2017-04-23T22:58:55Z", "link": {"author": [1810]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/the-world-of-bees", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-24T17:35:24Z", "type": "item", "id": 15912}

The competitions theme is: A Small World. We used our own open-sourced Java OpenGL game engine: [Flounder](https://github.com/Equilibrium-Games/Flounder-Engine). Polyorbis is open-source and can be found here: https://github.com/Equilibrium-Games/Polyorbis\n\n**Brief Features:**\n- Third person low poly art style.\n- Procedurally generated music.\n- Survival and action packed!\n- LWJGL OpenGL engine.\n- \"Fun and addictive!\"\n\n**About:** In Polyorbis you will compete with red enemies to survive, the longer you survive the harder enemies become. DecCorp has landed strategic boxes into nearby craters to supply you, from these boxes you can pick up pink hearts to gain health, and yellow boxes to refill ammunition. Be aware, enemies will spawn around these boxes. The enemies will shoot projectiles in an attempt to eliminate you, touching them will also damage you. You are able to launch your own projectiles, their charge will drop after repeated usage. Your score will increase the longer you survive and with the amount of enemies you destroy.\n\n![4.24.4.50.22.png](///raw/f97/1/z/232e.png)\n\n**Projectiles:** The first yellow attack is an inaccurate medium-damage common fast attack, the second blue attack is an accurate high-damage slow attack, and the third red attack is an explosion-shotgun style attack. \n\n**Controls:** WASD + Space to move. 1-2-3 (on keyboard) cycles the selected attacks (highlighted in the bottom left corner on the HUD), the mouse is used to aim, and left click to fire the selected attack. F1 toggles this help menu, F2 takes a screenshot to a roaming/home folder, F3 toggles a debug overlay, F4 toggles the HUD, F11 fullscreen, and Escape opens a pause menu with settings. To zoom the camera use the scroll wheel, and to orientate hold right mouse and move the mouse to a new angle.\n\n![4.24.4.49.48.png](///raw/f97/1/z/232c.png)\n\n**Download & install instructions:** To run Polyorbis you must have a graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.0 and higher, you can find that out from [this guide](http://support.esri.com/technical-article/000011375) (you might need to upgrade drivers). If you run Polyorbis and no display window is created, you most likely have outdated drivers.\n\nPolyorbis is built to run on Java 8, ensure you have a recent Java 8 build (or Java 9), if you need to install or upgrade java, use [this guide](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html).\n\nTo start the game run the downloaded .exe or .jar, that should be it. If you experience any crashes please report them. Screenshots and logs are saved in a folder called .polyorbis (might be hidden in your file explorer), found in your home folder (on Mac and Linux), or your [roaming folder](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2690709/windows/whats-in-the-hidden-windows-appdata-folder-and-how-to-find-it-if-you-need-it.html) (Windows).\n\n**Bugs/Crashes:** If you experience any replicable bugs or crashes please send a email to \"mattparks5855@gmail.com\", along with the log at the instance (found in roaming or home /.polyorbis/logs/**HOUR.MINUTE.SECOND-MONTH-DAY-YEAR**.log).\n\n**Follow Us:** Here are our Twitters and YouTubes:\n- Equilibrium Games: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EquilGame)\n- Decaxon: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/decaxon), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamingCubed3)\n- Mattparks: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mattparks5855), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9urardDd8fGDnUU0R7eKkQ)\n\n", "love": 0, "name": "Polyorbis", "parent": 9405, "author": 6047, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T21:25:44Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T02:12:13Z", "slug": "polyorbis", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67445, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 1, "published": "2017-04-24T17:23:25Z", "link": {"author": [6047, 21180]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/polyorbis", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-26T09:31:19Z", "type": "item", "id": 15983}

So we slowed the bullet down, slapped on the right behaviors, and voila- a nerf dart riding space man!\n\nFrom myself, Adriana, and Guin, we really hope you guys enjoy our project, and look forward to playing yours!\n \nDownloads:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B04XtDB-xAKKeklxMWNSS1o4WFk?usp=sharing\nOnline Version:\nhttps://www.scirra.com/arcade/action-games/ld38-big-dreams-17214", "love": 0, "name": "LD38 - Big Dreams", "parent": 9405, "author": 9998, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T21:33:25Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T05:07:39Z", "slug": "ld38-big-dreams", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 47282, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T05:07:39Z", "link": {"author": [9998, 12976]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/ld38-big-dreams", "type": "item", "id": 16070}

Finally you can craft your own spaceship and leave the planet.\n\n## Controls\n\n  * Arrows or WASD to move\n  * X to interact\n  * F to open Inventory\n  * In the inventory there is one special slot.

If for some reason all three cannot be placed, the unplaceable ships will be available for immediate spawning, but you can only spawn next to your base.\n\n### Links\n\n[Web](https://jdunlap1974.itch.io/suds-of-war) |\n[Windows (x86)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a15100cxx5fxl9s/SudsOfWar-rc1-Win-x86.zip?dl=0) |\n[Windows (x64)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wadgcubw0kuhvl7/SudsOfWar-rc1-Win-x64.zip?dl=0) |\n[MacOS (Universal)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m14oll5jsm731na/SudsOfWar-rc1-Mac-Universal.app.zip?dl=0) |\n[Linux (Universal}](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sph7fxxvnn6x9t9/SudsOfWar-rc1-Linux-Universal.zip?dl=0) |\n[Source on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/lonewolfstudios/sudsofwar)\n\nAdvanced warning that the Linux build has not been tested. Also, the Mac one required me to change some security settings on my MacBook.  If you know how to fix this, please let me know! (It complained that it was downloaded from Dropbox. I have it set to allow me to run programs that are not from the App Store.)\n\n### Controls\n\nLeft-Click to select or deselect a ship\nRight-Click after selecting to attack or move\n\n### Tips\n\nAt the bottom of the screen is an end turn button and the status of your ships.\n\nClick the ship icon to respawn a ship. Ships have a cooldown timer that is displayed on the button. The more ships you have down, the longer it takes them to respawn.\n\n### Goal\n\nYour goal is to destroy the enemy sponge before the enemy ships destroy your sponge.\n\n### Tools Used\n\n- Unity 5.6.0f3\n- Blender for 3D modeling and some rendering of GUI elements\n- Bfxr for creating sound effects\n- GIMP 2 for image editing\n- Audacity for editing audio files\n- LMMS for creating music\n\n\n### Contributors\n\nFor posterity sake, this game was developed completely in 72 hours by myself and my son.

Everything will be gone in five minutes, and as the station collapses the space you have to move safely decreases.

At the X:00 second mark that section will disappear. Get caught in the emptiness and your health will plummet -- you need the energy of the station to survive!\nIf your health reaches zero you'll be reset to the center of the platform and respawn in five seconds. In that time enemies will be spawning so your job will become that much harder!\nThe structures with health bars above them are Support Towers. Those are the target of (most of) the robots and the thing that will keep your run going longer. When one of those is destroyed, it will add time to a clock. That time will be deducted from your time at six times speed!\n\n![Player_Unit.png](///raw/a06/2/z/a46.png)This is you!

It will home in on a tower or you, whichever is closest.\n\n![Enemy_Bomber.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7f7.png)\nThe most dangerous robot by far is the Bomber. It roams between the towers, placing little 5-second treats that will explode, taking a tower with it.

But if you happen to dodge and their bullet hits a tower, they're okay with that too. A variant you'll see with 45 seconds remaining is the Spread Shooter. It has the same Spread Shot you can acquire!\n\n**Power-Ups:**\n\n![DMG.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7fb.png)Damage Power-Ups are Blue. They increase your damage by 1x. You can have up to Level 5 (5x damage).\n\n![RATE.png](///raw/a06/2/z/7fc.png)Rate Power-Ups are Green. They increase your fire rate by 30% each time you pick one up.

As such, some items will never appear in the game, and only a few items are in each play through.\n\n### Controls\n\n * `WASD` - move\n * `Space` - interact\n * `Enter` - pause/inventory\n\n### Links\n\n * [Source](https://github.com/bentglasstube/ld38/tree/ld38)\n * [Windows](https://bentglasstube.github.io/38/quest-island-windows.zip)\n * [Mac](https://bentglasstube.github.io/38/quest-island-osx.tgz)\n * [Linux](https://bentglasstube.github.io/38/quest-island-linux.tgz)\n\n![ss0.png](///raw/939/z/d96.png)\n![ss1.png](///raw/939/z/d9a.png)\n![ss2.png](///raw/939/z/da1.png)", "love": 0, "name": "Quest Island", "parent": 9405, "author": 2361, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T22:08:41Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T23:32:24Z", "slug": "quest-island", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 56476, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T01:41:38Z", "link": {"author": [2361]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/quest-island", "type": "item", "id": 16480}

{"body": "![j0RlkE.png](///raw/340/4/z/10fb.png)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48EPTk1fYDs\n\nLink: https://supergoose.itch.io/empathy-swap\n\nSource code: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4WSIBJH0kK2TEd2ejdYSlRVLWM\n\nThis game was made as a solo project for Ludum Dare 38 (Compo). The theme for the game jams was \"Small World\".\n\n\n\n**How To Play**\n\nStart with no resources. Plant mines to mine your planet for resources. Resources allow you to shoot missiles. Resources are also your health. Your health is reflected by the size of your planet. Get pickups to increase your health. Your paddle can shoot and can deflect missiles. You die when your health reaches zero. Last planet standing wins.\n\nAt random points throughout the game, an *Empathy Swap* will occur. Basically you swap to the other planet. One twist you could add is having to swap controllers at this point.\n\n\n\n**Backstory**\n\nMine resources in order to shoot missiles, gradually undermine your own defence in order to have a strong offence - a reflection of how we treat each other and our planet. A casual arcade game, or a sideways glance at the human condition, you decide.\u200b\n\nI used Unity 5 for dev, Adobe Illustrator CC for art and https://soundation.com/ for the music. I used http://www.bfxr.net/\u200b for sound effects.\n\n\n\n**Critique**\n\nThe game is an arena battle crossed with pong with a bit of RTS thrown in. As a game it definitely struggles with the \"too much going on\" side of game design, but the content was fun to make (particularly the sounds and voice acting) and I guess it could be quite strategic if you really got into it. It needs balancing too :\\\n\n\n**Requirements**\n\nRequires a controller and a keyboard. \n\nOnly works on screen res 16:9.\n\nOnly tested on Windows 10, Intel I5, Nvidia GTX 960, 16gb RAM.\n\nOne player on Gamepad one player on Keyboard.\n\n\n**Controls**\n\nI will be updating these so both players can play on one keyboard.\n\n*Gamepad controls (e.g. Xbox Controller)*\n\nLeft Analogue: Move orbit paddle\n\nA: Shoot\n\nB: Plant mine\n\n\n*Keyboard controls*\n\nA/D: Move orbit paddle\n\nW: Shoot\n\nS: Plant mine", "love": 0, "name": "Empathy Swap", "parent": 9405, "author": 16451, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T22:12:50Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T09:46:43Z", "slug": "empathy-swap", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 67877, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-23T20:23:16Z", "link": {"author": [16451]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/empathy-swap", "type": "item", "id": 16534}

As I got working on it, however, I became worried that if I made the game too simple, then it would only be fun for a couple minutes. I wanted something that could be fun for more time. Unfortunately, this made polishing the game very difficult. Not to mention that this is my first time doing an action game, and I underestimated the difficulty of balancing the physics. As such, there are some problems with collisions, and the jump upgrade may make the player jump too high. I would have also liked to add in animations for the inanimate objects in the game.\n\n## Future Plans:\n\n* Animations for the inanimate objects\n* Polishing the physics\n* Adding tons of levels\n\n## Screenshots:\n\n![desert.PNG](///raw/0d1/z/b5f.png)\n\n![world3.PNG](///raw/0d1/z/b61.png)\n\n![achievements.PNG](///raw/0d1/z/b63.png)", "love": 0, "name": "World Destroyer", "parent": 9405, "author": 464, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T22:15:48Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T14:49:11Z", "slug": "world-destroyer", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 49843, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 5, "published": "2017-04-24T00:54:02Z", "link": {"author": [464]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/world-destroyer", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-26T02:04:30Z", "type": "item", "id": 16562}

This is my first ever 'complete' game, and I'm proud to have done it in just over 48 hours.  This was a challenge, and I found that just getting rolling was one of the hardest parts.  I actually started developing two different games through the 48 hours, and what they had in common was utilizing gravity and joint/rope physics.  I'm very happy with the result, and hope you enjoy!\n\n### Story:\nSling Ship is a about an small exploration space-ship from Earth (our Small World), that was sucked into a black whole on an expedition.  With limited power, and only a tractor beam to assist in the journey, the ship and crew must jump between black holes in hopes of making their way back home. [Original Name: Sling Ship: Search For A Small World]\n\n### Gameplay:\n * 6 levels with open ended solutions\n * Utilize your tractor beam, and the gravity of planets to make your way across each level\n * Your ship will be destroyed if you crash into any planets/asteroids\n * You can tractor beam planets but not asteroids (there's 3 asteroids in the first level)\n * Game Over if you go outside the play space (unless you're currently latched to a planet)\n * Time is limited (Game Over for that level if it reaches zero)\n * Beam is limited (But no auto-loss if you run out)\n * NOTE: I ensured I was able to pass each level before saving (some are pretty easy, some pretty tough)\n\n### Controls:\nMouse-Click/Tap once to fire tractor beam at a planet \n\n### TODO:\n * Think about different level designs based on how the planets react (Maybe create a level editor)\n * Improve the position of the Tractor Beam (on moving planets I attached to center rather than exterior of planet)\n * Improve sound\n * Implement Score after each level (maybe based on Time Left + Tractor Beam left)\n * Create a high score system\n * Improve the UI\n * Improve how the game looks on mobile (all the UI is very small) and mobile functionality \n\n\n### A few resources I used:\nBasic Unity Tutorials\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/gamesplusjames\n\nBlack Hole Clip-Art:\nhttp://bit.ly/2pVOIBW\n\nPixel Planets\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/53066\n\nKenny Assets (UI)\nhttp://kenney.nl/assets\n\n", "love": 0, "name": "Sling Ship  \ud83c\udf0f", "parent": 9405, "author": 13909, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T22:31:39Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T15:02:04Z", "slug": "sling-ship-search-for-a-small-world", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 65790, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 3, "published": "2017-04-24T07:44:40Z", "link": {"author": [13909]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/sling-ship-search-for-a-small-world", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-24T16:53:55Z", "type": "item", "id": 16754}

NOTE: You may need to enable sound in ParaJVE; sometimes it seems to not be enabled by default.\n\nFor __Mac__ & __Linux__, get [ParaJVE](http://www.vectrex.fr/ParaJVE/) and then load ludumdare.bin from the zip.\n\nAll the above require a Java runtime. You may need to enable sound in ParaJVE if not enabled by default.\n\nFor a __REAL Vectrex__, just burn ludumdare.bin to an EPROM (or stick it on a dev cart of your choice).\n\n# Play it\n\n__THRUST:__ R (any button on hardware)\n\n__LEFT/RIGHT:__ Cursors (joystick on hardware)\n\nPick up passengers and drop them at their destinations.

Discover secrets all over a huge open world and 32 Science Labs. Burn a bush, find a staircase! Bomb a wall, find a cave! Behind a waterfall, an oracle giving out cryptic advice!\n\n## The Story Thus Far.....\n\nAll was going well at Corinthi 3 until the alien bugs showed up and wiped out the terraforming colonists. Fortunately, their work is still completed by automation over a hundred years.\n\nNow, you're a drone sent to cleans the world of the infestation so that it can be settled by proper civilized humans. Unfortunately, your cargo ship was destroyed by a stray meteor on the way here, so you'll just have to improvise.\n\nYour objective is to find and activate 32 of the science labs.

{"body": "![screen03.png](///raw/75c/2/z/b93.png)\n\nHello Everyone! Thanks for checking my page!\n\n***(Screenshots and links to the game + source code at the bottom)***\n\n***(There is currently only a Windows build as I have no way of testing Mac / Linus)***\n\nThis is the first every LD I have ever taken part in. While I did not finish even half of what I intended, I am excited to have drawn the line in the sand and have a working playable game for you guys to check out. I wasn't able to get to the tutorial part of the game, so below is a basic list of how to play the game.\n\n**Controls: **\n\nCustomizable at the splash screen, the inputs used by the game are: **Horizontal, Vertical, Fire1, Fire2**\n\n**W/A/S/D:** Move your character around the board.\n\n**Left Mouse:** \n\nDoes three important things, fires your grapple, pulls enemies that you have grappled, and destroys enemies during their vulnerable states (indicated by turning white temporarily.)\n\n**Right Mouse:**\n\nDoes one important thing, pulls your character to a grappled enemy. This is used to escape your side when you are overwhelmed.\n\n**Rules of the Game**\n\nEnemies will spawn on both sides, fire your grapple to grab the enemy, pull them to you, and destroy them for points. The more enemies that spawn while your on one side the higher the multiplier gets. You can also increase your multiply by pulling enemies over and not destroying them.\n\nSwapping sides with the (default)Right Mouse resets your multiplier, but may be the key to staying alive.\nThe score gained per kill is determined both by your combo and multiplier, so the key to big highscores is both.\n\nYou are not able to grapple or destroy enemies on your side of the board.\n\n**Good Luck!**\n\nI don't know if there are comments on the final submission, but if there are, please leave one and let me know your thoughts / experiences / and optionally your high score.\n\nIn the coming days I'll add a blog post talking about the development of the game; what I was aiming for, what went right, what went wrong and so on. Hopefully you'll swing by to check that out once it is up.\n\n\n\n![screen01.png](///raw/75c/2/z/b91.png)![screen02.png](///raw/75c/2/z/b92.png)![screen04.png](///raw/75c/2/z/b94.png)\n\nLink to the game(hosted on google):\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ab7jInYSyscnhJazhxNy1YREk/view?usp=sharing\n\nLink to the source code(on bitbucket):\nhttps://bitbucket.org/Izunah/ld38mindthegap\n\nTools used: Unity 5.6, Visual Studio 2017, BFXR, Google", "love": 0, "name": "Mind The Gap (First Ludum Dare)", "parent": 9405, "author": 11351, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T22:50:28Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T01:47:30Z", "slug": "mind-the-gap", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 45228, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T01:22:18Z", "link": {"author": [11351]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/mind-the-gap", "type": "item", "id": 16955}

It was designed and tested using an XBox 360 controller. Since this is a \"dual stick shooter\" - use the left stick to move your ship and the right stick to fire in any direction. You can also play using keys: W,A,S,D are for movement and the arrow keys are for firing. You can press Escape at any time to quit out of the game.\n\nYour aim is to kill the aliens, pick up the multipliers and get the highest score you can.\n\n![06.jpg](///raw/7e2/3/z/d58.jpg)\n\n## The Idea\n\nLike many others - I envisioned a small planet that you were tasked with protecting from an alien invasion. My greatest inspiration came from Geometry Wars 3. Originally I wanted you to protect the buildings on your planet however, this was dropped due to time constraints.\n\n![05.jpg](///raw/7e2/3/z/d5a.jpg)\n\n## The implementation\n\nGetting the movement mechanics was the highest priority. I was able to get the ship moving over the surface of the globe with movement relative to the camera. One problem that I encountered was what to do when the ship is directly beneath the camera (looking down at the planet) - this is effectively a \"gimbal lock\" scenario. I implemented a solution but I am not happy with it. After all that, it was a mad rush to get the shooting mechanics in followed by multipliers dropped by the aliens. I created two pieces of music (using a Sample Collection DVD called \"sound essentials vol. 4\") and I created various sound effects using sfxr. All the artwork was created by me - and I am most happy with the way the sky box turned out. Initially I started using a NASA space image but quickly realised that this was not in keeping with the \"create from scratch\" ideal so I used Paint Shop Pro and various noise, blurs, resizing and repeating to create something I like!\n\n![04.jpg](///raw/7e2/3/z/d5d.jpg)\n\n## Time-lapse Video\n\nFor some reason I was very excited to make my first ever time-lapse video! I used \"Chronolapse\" capturing at 1 frame every 10 seconds. I then created a video at 10fps and am playing this video at four times normal speed, rendered at 60fps. Here's the result:\n\n[![YouTube Link](http://img.youtube.com/vi/vR7CFJZWBjU/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR7CFJZWBjU)\n\n## The Wish-List\n\nSadly, I was not able to achieve all that I would have liked. Here's what was left on my wish-list:\n\n* Have two types of enemy - one that hunts the player and the other that attacks the buildings. These would be differentiated by colour.\n* Buildings would have a health bar and, once depleted, the building is razed to the ground\n* 3 lives for the player?\n* High Score table\n* Power-ups (better firepower)\n* Pause menu (with options to Resume, Restart, Volumes, Exit)\n* Sound and music volume options (rather than just on/off)\n* Animated water\n\n![03.jpg](///raw/7e2/3/z/eb2.jpg)\n\n## The fix list\n\nHere are things that needed fixing/improving:\n\n* Better texture on the world - with normal and/or displacement mapping?\n* Better (more detailed) buildings - with variety\n* Better player model\n* Why no shadows from the second directional light?\n* Handle the gimbal lock (when the player is directly below the camera) more smoothly\n* Optimise the enemy model - need fewer polygons and fewer materials\n\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nI have thoroughly enjoyed trying to make a game in such a short period of time and I am looking forward to playing as many of the other submissions as I can. I will definitely be doing this again!\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you enjoy Globe Trot!\n\n[Edit (25 April @ 16:17 GMT)]\n\nI forgot to add a list of tools used, so here it is: \n\n## Tools\n\nThe following tools were used to make the entire game:\n\n* Unity 5.6 (including the \"Post Processing Stack\" free from the Asset Store under \"Unity Essentials\")\n* Visual Studio 2013\n* 3DS Max 2012\n* Paint Shop Pro X9\n* Sony Acid Music Studio 10\n* Magix \"sound essentials vol. 4\" - DVD collection of sample loops\n* sfxr\n* GoldWave v6.27\n* \"Ultimate Font Download\" (http://www.ultimatefontdownload.com/)\n\noh yes, and:\n\n* Notepad (for my ToDo list...you've gotta have a ToDo list :grinning:)\n\nI also used the following:\n\n* Chronolapse - for the timelapse recording\n* ffmpeg - to compile the timelapse screen shots into a video\n* Sony MovieStudio Platinum 13 (to make the videos you see on this page)\n* WinRAR to compress the source and binary files\n", "love": 0, "name": "Globe Trot", "parent": 9405, "author": 13031, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T22:58:25Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T15:32:00Z", "slug": "globe-trot", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 65881, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 9, "published": "2017-04-24T01:00:10Z", "link": {"author": [13031]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/globe-trot", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-26T10:41:20Z", "type": "item", "id": 17057}

Um refugiado precisa estar sobre o alcance de um recurso. Cada recurso suporta 2 refugiados adjacentes ao card, para cima ou baixo. Se um refugiado ficar sem recursos essa \u00e9 considerada uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00e3o. Ao t\u00e9rmino turno em que uma tens\u00e3o \u00e9 gerada, o jogador deve puxar uma consequ\u00eancia.

As cartas de crise puxadas se acumulam no campo, e sempre que formam um grupo de 3, \u00e9 acrescentado 1 ao marcador de amea\u00e7a. Sempre que o marcador de amea\u00e7a \u00e9 acrescido em 1, a fila com mais refugiados \u00e9 destru\u00edda(a carta de guarda \u00e9 fica com a face para baixo). Os refugiados dela s\u00e3o realocados para a fila com menos refugiados. Gastando 3 a\u00e7\u00f5es o jogador consegue consertar uma fila destru\u00edda. Se houver um Agente Da Federa\u00e7\u00e3o, ou uma patrulha na fila \u00e0 ser destru\u00edda, esse pode ser sacrificado para impedir a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nMec\u00e2nica minoria: Caso em uma fileira de refugiados haja refugiados de planetas diferentes, podem acontecer que haja maioria de refugiados de um planeta. Nesse caso uma tens\u00e3o \u00e9 gerada. Exceto que haja um agente da federa\u00e7\u00e3o ou uma patrulha naquela fila. \nSe a rela\u00e7\u00e3o de maioria e minoria acontecer entre refugiados da mesma alian\u00e7a, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 tens\u00e3o. Crian\u00e7as n\u00e3o contam n\u00e3o contam para contar maioria, a n\u00e3o ser que haja um adulto do mesmo planeta. \n\nQuando uma fam\u00edlia estiver completa, e for a primeira da fila, o jogador pode gastar uma a\u00e7\u00e3o para passar uma fam\u00edlia para o outro lado da fronteira. Ao fazer isso o jogador pode retroceder o marcador de perigo em 1 numero, ou avan\u00e7ar o de seguran\u00e7a em 1 numero.

{"body": "![banner.png](///raw/f36/2/z/24f1.png)\n## DESCRIPTION:\n\nNaughty Gnomes is a 2D Puzzle game made with the LITIengine (https://litiengine.com)\nYour nose has been stolen by damn gnomes and they brought it to their small living places. Since you are a large and lanky clown, you are too big to enter their homes. Instead, you can get your nose back by hitting all gnomes with cake to knock them out and make them surrender.\n\n**HOW TO PLAY:**\nYou will see a box on the floor indicating your throwing direction and origin. Press and hold *MOUSE1* to load up your throw and wait until your target tile is marked. Then, release *MOUSE1* to throw. Throwing the cakes is tile-based, and you have limited range, so don't waste any precious cakes! On impact, the cakes' explosion will spread to each adjacent tile (kinda like bomberman!).

Once you gather all the gems, you can go to the right of the main map and find a gray line. When you press enter at the gray line you will be moved to a map with a man whom once you talk to you win!

Miners automatically mine the closest ore, idiotically dumping the mined ore into a common container where it all gets mixed together.\n\nMixed ores can be used to improve both ores, or beef up the quantity of another more expensive ore.

Right now its called __MaruGen__, which means __MA__chinations __RU__leset __GEN__erator.\n\nI took ideas from the concepts of __Micro-Machinations__ and  __Mission/Space__ frameworks by Joris Dormans, an created a tool that can be used to \"generate\" Worlds, mechanics and objectives, given a series of user defined rules and a series of packaded rulesets executed in a certain order to create procedural spaces and mechanichs.\n\nThe idea is to find a way to explore the concept of _\"emergence in games\"_, mainly described by Dormans in his frameworks, and by other game designer such as Keith Burgun and Raph Koster.

If it has another species occupying that tile, you will have to do battle with them to take control.\n\nBattles use Attack, Defense, and Dexterity to determine the outcome of the conflict. If you win a battle, the other species is eradicated, and your surviving population takes control of that tile. If you lose, you lose the population sent to that tile, but you might weaken the enemies population for another attempt.\n\nAfter each migration, the world is updated and every tile that is occupied will have their population increase or decrease based on how compatible the biome is to the species in that space.\n\nSo... yeah, that's about it! I had more plans for having win/lose conditions, but not enough time to implement them. If I wanted to go further with this game, I have a lot of plans, like, random events that take place and do things, giving the player ways to upgrade or level up their species... having the enemy species move and try to migrate as well, etc...\n\nBut, I think it's pretty neat for a game done in 2 days!!!", "love": 0, "name": "Planetary Engagement", "parent": 9405, "author": 17275, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T23:21:52Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-23T23:44:27Z", "slug": "planetary-engagement", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 41202, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-23T23:44:27Z", "link": {"author": [17275]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/planetary-engagement", "type": "item", "id": 17365}

Frames only count down when you're moving, so you can take time to look around. The goal is to be the last one standing! \n\n* Move with WASD/Arrow keys. Look around with mouse.\n* Shoot with mouse left click.\n* Hold space to skip frames.\n\n## How the World Works\n\nYou as the player experience the world in **segregated time slices**. Every round, you get to act out your next 100 frames of motion. Every other player gets to do so too. You don't know what other players are plotting for their next 100 frames, but you try to **predict**. Once everyone has completed their 100 frames of motion, everyone rewinds, and the game world plays everyone's actions in real time. \n\nFor example, here I try to move towards the player I see, and I shoot at the tree (just for fun).\n\n![run_and_gun.gif](///raw/9d4/z/2120.gif)\n\nThat is my predicted motion. But when it plays back:\n\n![rewind_2.gif](///raw/9d4/z/2127.gif)\n\nI realize the other player has moved during that time! So if you want to shoot them, you can't shoot at **where they are**, but where you **think they will be in the next 100 frames**. \n\n## Credits\n\nArt by [Sara Jamros](http://pooba1234.deviantart.com/)\n\nProgramming by [Omar Shehata](https://twitter.com/omar4ur)\n\nMade with [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/).\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![one.png](///raw/9d4/z/210b.png)\n\n![three.png](///raw/9d4/z/211a.png)\n\n## Inspiration\n\n[Why we made this game](http://bit.ly/2oKo7UF).\n\nWe'd love to hear any feedback or ideas!\n", "love": 0, "name": "ChronoCombat", "parent": 9405, "author": 1241, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T23:25:02Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T04:07:18Z", "slug": "chronocombat", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67641, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T01:46:14Z", "link": {"author": [1241, 27585]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/chronocombat", "type": "item", "id": 17406}

I want to add indicators on metrics to show if they're increasing or decreasing.\n* Lack of constructs/agents, time constraints led to a very shallow pool of entities.\n* Lack of a skip button for dialog, and options to control music/audio.\n\n## Technology\n* Written in TypeScript using the Ionic Framework on top of Apache Cordova.\n* Graphics done in Photoshop CC.\n* Music generated using http://tones.wolfram.com\n\n\n", "love": 0, "name": "RSV Resourcer", "parent": 9405, "author": 10655, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-21T23:52:52Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T17:32:50Z", "slug": "rsv-resourcer", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 50981, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T01:15:10Z", "link": {"author": [10655]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/rsv-resourcer", "type": "item", "id": 17844}

Ah, what could've been\u2026\n\nThe fact that anything is being uploaded at all is an absolute miracle. Big thanks to HeartBeast for his tutorial series - they got me from zero to here, which is progress!\n\nOutstanding bugs/issues:\n\n- The text in some signs appears above the dialogue box object. I think it's something to do with my display_scale variable but I don't have the gas to figure it out!\n\n- Sometimes crashes when attacking an enemy. Not sure what causes this but is probably related to obj_damage.\n\n- No 'Game Over' screen. I JUST RAN OUT OF TIME OK.\n\n- Controller support is implemented but not tested so...y'know...play at your own risk.\n\n- No sounds. Again, timings!\n\nAh well, I had a lot of fun and learned a bunch about coding in GameMaker.

How do you do that? Collecting Gold Bricks, of course! Even better: If you collect a Gold Coin, you'll multiply the amount of Gold you receive! How does collecting gold save your planet? Who knows. Does it really matter?\n\nAs you move your character around the world, the landscape will begin to crumble around you and monsters will hunt you down. Don't stay still for too long or you risk not only getting eaten, but the land falling out from under you. Fall into the abyss and it's game over!\n\nThankfully, you have a magic gift for being able to create new land masses around you! Your magic's not unlimited, unfortunately, but it is regenerating. Luckily, there are also heart icons you can pick up in-case you lose any health and an armor icon for temporary invincibility!\n\nSo get out there and save the world before it falls apart beneath you!\n\n## Controls:\n\nAll setup schemes below are supported at the same time.\n\n### Setup #1\n\n* Arrow Keys to move\n* Z to jump\n* X to use magic\n\n### Setup #2\n\n* WASD to move\n* Space to jump\n* E to use magic\n\n### Setup #3\n\n* WASD to move\n* Space to jump\n* Left-click the mouse button to use magic\n\n## Devlog:\n\n* v0.3 - Fixing the magic meter from being infinite.\n* v0.2 - Fixing crucial bugs: high scores weren't being logged correctly.

So does enemies.\n* Don't forget to jump! You can jump over enemies and terrains.\n* Standing in water makes your magic meter regenerate faster.\n* Standing in a forest makes your magic meter regenerate slower.\n* Use mountains to keep enemies from approaching you.\n* Collect gold coins first if there are a lot of gold bars around.

Or shall we just dance away the hour until the world runs down?\n\nIdea and theme connection\n======\nThis is a rhythm game. I came into the weekend wanting to write a waltz. The theme  made me think about the world as possibly in danger from climate change and nuclear war, and how small and fragile it is (from that point of view). Then I remembered stories of the Titanic's band continuing to play as the ship went down ... so that is my game idea. One last waltz as the world sinks.\n\nInspiration\n=======\nI wanted the game to have an \"arcade\" feel, and I almost totally failed at that. Super Hexagon is one of my favorite games, and the feelings I have when I play it remind me of swing dancing. I was aiming to re-create that feeling through my game, but the control scheme ended up being too fiddly. I think that by making the gameplay too much like real dancing I painted myself into a corner ... a tap-based rhythm game. And there is a reason I don't really like those types of games. If I were to do this again I'd spend a lot more time brainstorming control schemes. While I did a good job of idea generation after receiving the theme, and not settling too early, I failed to do the same with the control scheme.\n\nVoting Category Opt-outs\n========\n\nCode, art, music were all written by me, so no opt-outs.

{"body": "I wanted to try my hand at making a graphics-centric game, but that got me thinking about what my ideal sprite editor would be like. I ended up making a prototype of the sprite editor instead. It functions entirely unlike any other sprite editor I've seen, so give it a try and see if there are any novel ideas you like. Since it doesn't really make sense to judge this tool alongside a bunch of games, I'm going to be opting out of all judging categories.\n\nSome rushed documentation will pop up when you open the editor. I hope you'll be able to work it out. I was a lazybutt this LD, so it's all kind of a mess.\n\nSince there are no links yet, [click here to try the editor.](https://pitzik4.github.io/jag-editor/index.html) [The source code is available here.](https://github.com/Pitzik4/jag-editor)", "love": 0, "name": "Jag Editor", "parent": 9405, "author": 1788, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T00:28:34Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T03:04:34Z", "slug": "jag-editor", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 63143, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T02:22:45Z", "link": {"author": [1788]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/jag-editor", "type": "item", "id": 18434}

Amass money doing so. Build turrets using the money to better defend the world from the oncoming attacks. When you're properly defended, build nuclear centrifuges to win the game!\n\nMy take on the theme was you play as North Korea on a small world being attacked by everyone. The idea was that you'd build nuclear centrifuges to create a nuclear warhead. The game would then end with the warhead being fired, failing and turning round, blowing up the planet. Didn't manage to that done in the end. Need to work on my timing.\n\nThis is my 8th Ludum Dare. You can view my other games here. http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/cryogenesis/#hidepopup\n\n## Technical Summary \n\nI was supposed to submit this to the compo, didn't manage to get enough done in the first day to be able to finish in time. For some reason I thought it was a good idea to write the whole thing from scratch. Turns out it was a total time waste.\n\nGame runs best on a fast CPU, preferably faster than 2.3Ghz. The first day, I spent writing the world generator that uses perlin noise to generate the terrain. Then I wrote a software renderer that'd draw the planet pixel-by-pixel, and the objects on it / around it. This is why the game's so low-res. If you zoom into some of the objects the pixel-art is moderately detailed though.\n\nWritten in pure Java, using the in built Swing libraries. Art made using GIMP. Sound, using FL Studio and SFXR.\n\n## Links\n* Windows/Mac/Linux: https://github.com/CryoGenesis/ldjam38/blob/master/BUILD/ldjam38.zip\n(Redirects to github, click the download button right of the filesize indicator)\n* Source code: https://github.com/CryoGenesis/ldjam38\n\n\n", "love": 0, "name": "DPRK Defence Force", "parent": 9405, "author": 12704, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T00:28:37Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T00:38:24Z", "slug": "dprk-defence-force", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 58371, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T00:38:24Z", "link": {"author": [12704]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/dprk-defence-force", "type": "item", "id": 18435}

You win a round by having more points than the other player.\n\nThe game begins by dealing 8 terrain cards to you. You then must select 8 different units cards to play the game with. Each unit card has a strength value and a modifier. Modifiers can be affected by the terrain card so take note. \n\nThe game then deals out the points on the empty tiles. \n\nThe players then go about adding terrain cards to the point tiles. You want to have high point values with terrain that your units can benefit from. Note what your opponent is doing as well. \n\nThe game starts by players placing units on the tiles. The points are then added to your score.\n\nYou can forfeit a round if you think you can win the next couple by pressing the end round button.\n\n## Links\n\nhttps://savethejets.itch.io/titanomachy\n\n\n\n", "love": 0, "name": "Titanomachy", "parent": 9405, "author": 6667, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T00:28:44Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T01:37:56Z", "slug": "battle-of-the-gods", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 44892, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T01:08:36Z", "link": {"author": [6667]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/battle-of-the-gods", "type": "item", "id": 18437}

This is something that I didn't expect when I had finished developing the game:\n- The creature's AI. \n\nWhat Went Wrong:\n- There are few minor bugs regarding the creature's AI system.\n\nWhat is not included(Due to lack of time):\n- A fourth species which looks like a human and can shoot nukes directly into you (adding some difficulty to the game)\n- An Evolution System. Every time you use a certain ability, the creatures get less damage from it over time.\n- No Music\n- No Story and Tutorial included in the game\n\nYoutube Links:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rD4IbNjKyy0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XnDL2OZ1Qx8\n\n\n![Screenshot 2.png](///raw/dd6/2/z/20b2.png)\n![Screenshot 4.png](///raw/dd6/2/z/232d.png)\n![Screenshot 6.png](///raw/dd6/2/z/2349.png)\n![Screenshot 8.png](///raw/dd6/2/z/234d.png)\n![Screenshot 9.png](///raw/dd6/2/z/234f.png)\n![Screenshot 3.png](///raw/dd6/2/z/2352.png)\n![Screenshot 7.png](///raw/dd6/2/z/2363.png)", "love": 0, "name": "Statera", "parent": 9405, "author": 9949, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T00:33:20Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T06:52:11Z", "slug": "statera", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 64478, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T16:10:48Z", "link": {"author": [9949]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/statera", "type": "item", "id": 18518}

My name is Fernando Adolfo and I'm a little videogame developer that published two games (with awfull results).\n\n**About the theme**\n\nWhen the theme was announced, I thought everyone would do a planet or something similar to that so I began to think about what a world could be. Maybe for the mayority of us our world is all the world, but it isn't always like that. The world for some fishes is a fishbowl. Some animals live in the house of their owners or in a room of a zoo. And for someone who is jailed his world is his jail.\n\n![screenshot3.png](///raw/ae1/3/z/2519.png)\n\n**About the game**\n\nMy game is some kind of prisoner simulator. You have to live in jail and try to spend the time. But is not so easy to live so monotonous life. You need to entertain yourself with no so much things to do, without neglecting food and hygiene. If your mood decreases you could do some crazy thing.\n\n![screenshot2.png](///raw/ae1/3/z/251a.png)\n\n**Controls**\n\nYou can move the character with WASD (you can configure this in desktop builds)\nYou can interact with some things (the text of an action will be appear) with E, Space bar or left click.\nYou can show or hide a secret interface which can help you with H, but don't use it please, is a cheat.\n\n![ute - gui.png](///raw/ae1/3/z/251b.png)\n\n**About my work with this game**\n\nI made all by myself in this game except the following things that belong to the Standard Assets of Unity engine: The code for the character movement (I made several modifications), the code for the camera movement (I made a few modifications) and the animations for characters which are the originals of Unity Standard Assets.\n\n![screenshot5.png](///raw/ae1/3/z/251c.png)\n\n**Link to the game**\n\nhttps://fernandoadolfo.itch.io/until-the-end\n\nEnjoy it and think about it!", "love": 0, "name": "Until the End", "parent": 9405, "author": 12778, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T00:38:31Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T10:38:42Z", "slug": "until-the-end", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 65082, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T01:01:47Z", "link": {"author": [12778]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/until-the-end", "type": "item", "id": 18622}

Gravitational Pull\nEach planet has a gravitational pull and because our small world is so compact and dense enough to ram other planets it has a much stronger gravitational pull which tends to pull the other planets around.\n\n2. Health\nEach planet has 100 health points; including our small world.  Each planet does 1 point of damamge while our world does 5 points of damage.  Damage is determined by which planet has more magnitidue on impact so be careful because your world can get destroyed.\n\n3.

{"body": "\nHello everybody!\n\nMy name is Anubhav Kashyap and I am a thirteen year old game developer.\n\nMy game is a small survival game created for the Ludum Dare Game Jam 38. THEME: A SMALL WORLD\n\n![Screenshot.png](///raw/d68/3/z/254e.png)\n\nHow to Play:\n\n     You are a sailor stranded on a strange island. You have got only an axe with you. Use it to cut wood and build anything you want. But remember, you need food to survive. Look for the small bushes which grow in the forest. They are your only means of food.\n\nGoal:\n\n     Survive for five days.\n\nControls:\n\n     LMB: Place objects, cut trees.\n     RMB: Delete objects.\n     LMB and Drag: Drag objects.\n     R: Point the cursor over an object and press R to rotate it.\n     \n     There are 2 sliders to the bottom left.\n     The first one is for Health and the second one is for Hunger.\n     The hunger bar increases when we are hungry.\n\nResources Required:\n\n     Wooden Wall: 50 wood\n     Wooden Floor: 50 wood\n     Campfire: 20 wood\n     Crate: 20 wood\n\nAnd most important of all, remember that the game is bound to have a few glitches. After all, it was made in 2 days. And anyways, I wasted the first day. So please play the game and rate it accordingly. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n##LINKS\n\nhttps://anubhav-kashyap.itch.io/survival-game-ldjam", "love": 0, "name": "Survival Game", "parent": 9405, "author": 14445, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T01:21:19Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T11:30:30Z", "slug": "survival-game", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 65213, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T18:58:07Z", "link": {"author": [14445]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/survival-game", "type": "item", "id": 19315}

{"body": "\"So she went after him\" takes the theme as a really small thing, which was conceptualiced in some dialogs (not the strongest thing in the game)\n\n![Title.png](///raw/c3d/2/z/7cd.png)\n\nThe game was inspired by \"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\". Thought, it's a bit more scifi. You'll be incarnating Jean who is a little girl that met a boy behind a fence (named Seven), he is a test subject in the complex were he is; and one day local security finds out about the two kids little hangouts, so they jail him away. In this game, Jean, goes after Seven.\n\nSo I wanted to try doing some stealth stuff on this one, and spend like the whole time of the compo getting it right (even so there is always tons of tweaks that can be done). But then I realized that I haven't had time to make the art the way I wanted, so ended up with some silouethes... again (same as last LD experience).\nStill, its a really small and incomplete game, that I'll be working on from now on (:\n\n\n\n\nGame: http://gamejolt.com/games/sswah/251797\n\nSource: http://framematt.com/sswah_source.rar\n\n\n\n\n\nPS.

{"body": "![petri animation.gif](///raw/c40/3/z/25f6.gif)\nA very simple strategy game that takes place entirely inside the confines of a petri dish. Control you microbes to eradicate the germs. Watch out for wandering viruses and (mostly) deadly anti-biotics!\n\nYes I am aware of the crumby title. This is a game making jam, not a game title jam. :grin:\n\n## Links\n1. [Download!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6wGpL1DamiiOUM2cHAySWZ2LUE/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Gameplay\n### Probiotics\nYou start every round with a singular microbe. Your goal is to eliminate all your enemies (the Germs) to move on, but it won't be so easy. You can't consume an enemy germ unless you're large enough (2 sizes bigger).\n### Growing\nTo grow your microbe you must consume things. You can consume food (green orbs), smaller germs, or even your own microbes.\n (you monster!)\n### Splitting\nYou can only grow so much though. After a certain point your microbe will divide into two smaller microbes. This grants you a tactical advantage but also makes you vulnerable until you grow larger again.\n### Dangers\nNot only are there germs running around trying to consume you, but there are also dangers like viruses. A virus can infect any microbe and after a few turns the microbe will die and release two viruses. Viruses will shift about aimlessly but don't get caught off gaurd!\nThere are also deadly anti-biotics. At least ... they're mostly deadly. Legend tells of some microbes having the ability to consume this deadly poison without any ill effects.\n\n![2017-04-25 11_38_00-Ludum Dare 38 - A Small World.png](///raw/c40/3/z/25f7.png)\n![2017-04-25 11_39_32-Ludum Dare 38 - A Small World.png](///raw/c40/3/z/25f8.png)", "love": 0, "name": "Petri-geddon", "parent": 9405, "author": 12364, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T01:41:17Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T02:51:04Z", "slug": "petri-geddon", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67498, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T01:46:57Z", "link": {"author": [12364]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/petri-geddon", "type": "item", "id": 19558}

It\u2019s a small god/puzzle game where you must create a planet which can sustain life by blocking unwanted asteroids and letting others crash into your planet adding their element which they carry and progressing from a small world to a large one. \n\n\nThe game is available to play on itch.io as both a browser game and a Windows download: \n# [- Click To Play -](https://turnwolf.itch.io/theydancewithasteroids)\n\n\n![LudumDare38_Screen1.gif](///raw/fa2/z/186e.gif)\n\n## How-To-Play\n** Controls: ** Grab your mouse because that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to need! Left click on an asteroid, hold that button down drag in the direction you want to fling it and let go and watch that baby fly. \n\n** Concept: ** Crash asteroids into your planet and watch as the element which is signified by its element symbol makes a change to your planet. Experiment to find out what element does what. \n\n** Aim: ** Get your planet to that goldilocks zone so it can start to grow life. Watch as life slowly rises in your world and when it reaches 100% you get a cookie! \u2013 Well not really but you do win!\n\n## Software and Development\nThis game was mostly created in one sleepless coffee induced coder-thon where I tried to make up for my lack of time on day one. I used Unity to create the game, as this is the engine I am most familiar with and will be working with in the future - so good practice to. Blender for the small amount of 3D modelling I had to do for this project which I wanted to keep to a minimum. Photoshop was used to create all the textures for the 3D models and the particles and finally sound was created on http://www.bfxr.net. \n\n## Opt-Out\nI did not make the music, the track used was sourced from: Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)  - Ambiment - Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0. \n\n## Feature List - Completed\n- Asteroids with Elements represented by their respective periodic element symbol. \n- Planet smoothly changes in form and colouration with asteroid impacts.\n- Simple main menu and credits.\n- Basic Sound and music. \n\n## Feature List - MIA\n- Tutorial level.\n- Better more user-friendly UI. \n- Better asteroid spawning. \n- Two more levels with different difficulties. \n\n## Links\n\n** Website: ** [www.turnwolfproductions.com](http://www.turnwolfproductions.com)\n\n** Twitter: ** [www.twitter.com/turnwolf](www.twitter.com/turnwolf)\n\n** YouTube: ** [www.youtube.com/turnwolfproductions](www.youtube.com/turnwolfproductions)\n\n** Thank you for taking the time to look at my game, any feedback is appreciated! **\n", "love": 0, "name": "They Dance With Asteroids", "parent": 9405, "author": 687, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T02:25:43Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T22:31:36Z", "slug": "they-dance-with-asteroids", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 55075, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T22:31:36Z", "link": {"author": [687]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/they-dance-with-asteroids", "type": "item", "id": 19813}

Can you help him navigate the high seas and reach the New World safely?\n\n![LandAhoy2.png](///raw/cbb/2/z/1580.png)\n\n## About\n\nI made the game as a solo developer over the course of two and a half days. The game runs on my homemade game engine. The game is 95% C++ and 5% AngelScript. I used Visual Studio 2013 for the programming. The modeling and texturing was done in Blender and GIMP. I used the awesome space-3d tool to generate the skybox (https://github.com/wwwtyro/space-3d). The font I used is called \"Vinque\". Unfortunately I did not have time to add sounds.\n\n## System Requirements\n* Windows 7 or newer (64-bit only)\n* Visual C++ 2013 x64 runtimes\n* A DX11 graphics card with up-to-date drivers\n\n## Links\n* [Download link](http://www.sourcedrive.net/LD38/LandAhoy.zip)\n* [YouTube video link](https://youtu.be/pp8qUaTMp4w)\n\n## Note\n\nThe game engine is built first and foremost for multiplayer games and it has a client/server architecture which means that even for single player games (such as Land Ahoy!) there is some network communication going on. Depending on your firewall settings you may get a popup asking you to confirm the connection. Rest assured the game is not communicating with the outside world in any way. The only connection is between the client and server within the same process. You can verify this with a tool such as Wireshark.\n\nIf the game runs poorly on your machine you can disable some graphical effects. There is no settings menu but you can press F12 to open the debug overlay and then F8 to open the render options.

The game's name comes from the fact that this path forms the [dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve).\n\nI was going for the idea that you play this little game in what is (as far as you can tell) the entire world, but then at the end of the wave it grows, and your \"small world\" becomes a bit bigger (although the things in it don't grow, so you can see the smaller things that you placed earlier in the game).\n\nI didn't get to checking for any sort of collision/overlapping so you're free to place towers anywhere you like (on the path, on other towers, the possibilities are endless!). You can enforce placing towers in open spaces yourself if you're looking for a bit of an extra challenge. :)\n\nI used [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten) for an engine, which I opted for over [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) because it's web build supports audio.

{"body": "Protect your home planet from rogue asteroids and alien invaders!\n\nHello User!\n----\nWelcome to Asteroids, a game made in 72 hours for Ludum Dare #38.\n\nThe theme was A Small World, so we came up with a concept that involved much harder mechanics than that is currently implemented right now. These involved planetary rotation to simulate a solar system, multiple enemy types, and attacks/variations. We decided to go small and easy, what we came up with is Asteroids, a small 2D action/strategy game. You play as the little character on top of the earth, and are armed with a bat to deflect asteroids that come flying in randomly from space. Be weary though, alien's will also come to try to destroy your planet as all they seek for is the destruction of the human race!\n\nSurvive for 60 seconds as you get pelted with multiple threats from every direction.\n\n\n**Asteroids: https://blazexenon.itch.io/asteroids**\n\n\n_(Screenshots are available on the itch.io page!)_\n\n\n----\n\nThis game was made by My friend and I for LD38.", "love": 0, "name": "Asteroids", "parent": 9405, "author": 10156, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T04:59:58Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T23:54:37Z", "slug": "asteroids", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 57044, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T23:54:37Z", "link": {"author": [10156, 10155]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/asteroids", "type": "item", "id": 20389}

It is your task to help them gather enough resources and protect them from danger, ultimately allowing them to escape the island.\n- @spelos (Lead programmer)\n- @Karba (Lead artist)\n\n# How to play\n- **[A][D]** => Wind-Push: Pushes all survivors slightly to the left or right. (Has cooldown)\n- **[W]** => Tidal wave: Summons a large tidal wave. All survivors get colder.\n- **[SPACE]** => Earthquake: Makes survivors gather resources for a few seconds. (Hurts them by 10 HP) | Deflects Cthulhu when - attacking\n- **[E]** => Escape: Evacuates survivors when enough resources (150 Wood, 200 Stone, 5+ survivors) is collected.\n\n## Q&A\n* **My survivors don't gather resources I want them to get** - That is the challenge, use Wind-Push and Earthquake to try to get them to cooperate. Alternatively, build a Hut and get more survivors, surely some will cooperate.\n* **My survivor just stands and does nothing / Works without result without end** - Earthquake ability usually helps survivors get their priorities straight.\n* **I don't understand how to protect survivors** - When an enemy is attacking, you have to use Earthquake ability before he gets to the middle of the island.

In Crumble, the world is a platform that consists of boxes, and one by one they fall away. The idea is simple: if you fall, you lose.\n\n*In the multiplayer mode*, you have access to a range of powerups that help you mess with your opponents. Try knocking them over the edge - the last man standing wins the game! This is the intended way to play the game, have fun with some friends!\n\n*In the singleplayer mode*, you play a time-attack style game where you try to last as long as possible. The old rules still stand, including a countdown clock: if you run out of time, you lose.\n\nThis fits the 'small world' theme, because, well, the platform is small. And it gets even smaller.\n\n## Downloads:\n\nGet the game and the source code on itch.io: https://binaryspark.itch.io/crumble\n\n**You can play the game in your browser, but PLEASE NOTE that the WebGL build has much worse performance than the Windows build.

{"body": "![Abaddon02.jpg](///raw/991/z/857.jpg)\n\nAbaddon is the hebrew name for the angel of the abyss in the Bible (apocalypse 9:11). Today this is just my entry for the 38th LudumDare session. I did a paced FPS - a survival game in which you must fight against a horde of mischievous creatures in a little arena (50x50). The columns delimitate your small world. When you see them, it means that you are not far to the void. Be careful! Each creature has its own behavior : a skull follows you in a wave movement and explodes near of you. A ram twirls around you, trying to hit you. A spider is looking for fresh meat and it spits on you its poison. The monster comes from the ground and knocks you really hard...\nExcepted the last specie, you cannot see how and where are spawned the enemies. I did many scripts to create an oppressive and darkly environement from which the creatures appear. You are always surounded by them. Kill them and try to do the best score which will be saved automatiquelly in a leaderboard - the hall of fame. Using the LMB, you shoot fireballs, also using RMB, you shoot like with a shotgun, but its firerate is low. When you kill a monster or a spider, some blue dust appears. Passing through it, you gain health...\nI guess that if you can (more or less) define how the spawn script works, you can elaborate an efficient strategy. Please play this game and tell me your point of view. I hope that you enjoy. Thank you. I wish you the best.

A tree plantet by the gods to set root in our small, fragile world and to confront and to unite the everlasting powers which try to sunder it. It is your task to help this man to defy the unpredictable elements and grow a tree which is able to do this task. You have to help this man and decide his and so the world's destiny!\n\n## Manual\nUse the arrow buttons to walk. Yggdrasil needs water and light to grow. The both upper left bars indicate Yggdrasil\u2019s nutrition. If one of them hits zero you lose. The upper right bar indicates Yggdrasil's progress to its next growing stage. You level up once you reach a new stage after it blossoms. Naturally, Yggdrasil needs more care the higher its level.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![title.png](///raw/022/3/z/1632.png)\n\n![ingame.png](///raw/022/3/z/1640.png)\n\n![ingame2.png](///raw/022/3/z/24b1.png)\n\n## Link\n**WEB:** http://joschac.github.io/ld38/\n\n__Does not work on tablet and/or phone.__\n\n\nVoting Opt-Out: Audio", "love": 0, "name": "Yggdragrow", "parent": 9405, "author": 12832, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T06:43:12Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T07:38:13Z", "slug": "yggdragrow", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 64600, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T08:17:45Z", "link": {"author": [12832, 13479, 13452]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/yggdragrow", "type": "item", "id": 20809}

As you can see I kept the graphics pretty simple because my Photoshop and Blender skills are close to non existent. The mechanics are pretty simple and I mostly got them working in the first day. Second day was adding sound/music (totally overestimated my ability to do this), tweaking the graphics, creating the main menu and mostly trying to make it playable.\n\n__Some Notes for the future:__\n- I spent a lot of time reading the Unity Scripting API, UnityAnswers forum and StackOverflow. This was pretty unavoidable since it was my first time doing it but I'm sure I'll improve with time.\n- I got stuck refactoring part of the code and trying to make it more optimal. This made me waste a lot of time and got me frustrated. Ultimately I had to end hardcoding a lot of stuff anyway. Stupid for such a simple game.\n- I also didn't account for how my personal efficiency would plummet throughout the last hours.  \n\n## Tools\n- Unity 5.5\n- W10 voice recorder\n- Audio converter\n- beepbox (For the music)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Source Code](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwrr1z8bpijfn9z/A%20Too%20Small%20World%20Source%20Code.rar?dl=0)\n- [Win32](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ce5nrujhh1keb1z/Win.rar?dl=0)\n- [MacOS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/varhu865ro6fxlj/MacOS.app.rar?dl=0)\n- [Linux](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q37rn9s2euqrux1/Linux.rar?dl=0)\n- [Web](https://gris.itch.io/beware-the-idiots)\n\n## 48hours + Noob = Bugs\n\nSome of these are just improvements. Some are easy to solve(just needed more time) others require me to research. Since I'm not sure if I can make changes I'll just note them down below.\n\n- Clearer output on when the eggs shield is down\n- Quick sperm goes through the edgecollider(It wasn't meant to be this way)\n- Smoother lines (or maybe get rid of them? We'll see)\n- Better screen adjustment(mostly in the main menu)\n- Difficulty levels (Old man:Easy, Married middle aged man: Medium, Horny Teenager: Hard, Mr BlueBalls: Extreme)\n- Maybe keep a record of highscores?\n- Upgrades(different types of bait) \n\n\n", "love": 0, "name": "Beware The Idiots", "parent": 9405, "author": 12061, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T06:55:47Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T15:50:00Z", "slug": "beware-the-idiots", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 50240, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T01:00:19Z", "link": {"author": [12061]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/beware-the-idiots", "type": "item", "id": 20855}

As you destroy asteroids,\nyour score will increase, and at certain intervals, your missiles will upgrade.\nHowever, as your weapons may improve, the asteroids will increase in size,\nspeed, and density, so it will gradually get more difficult. If any asteroid\nmakes contact with the world, it is game over.\n\nLooking Back\n------------\nThis is my first successfully completed game ever. I know it's not going to be\nthe most impressive or complete game on here, but I was certainly impressed with\nwhat I was able to do in the time, I had a lot of fun making it, and I learned\nan incredible amount about game development.

We agreed that we wanted to challenge ourselves technically, but also take on a manageable enough task so that we could spend some time on juice and polish. With that in mind, we scrapped the 2D roguelike we had been toying with and decided to go with @william-za's idea for a game where you destroy planets by flinging asteroids at them. \n\nThe idea fit the theme so well.

{"body": "**Game link:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3qNwrOqvxw5X1VOS2hrVUJLZ1U/view?usp=sharing\n\nBug Fixes 04/24/17:\nSo a friend pointed out a bug that would destroy the gameplay. At a point the waste would be produced so fast, that it would instantly destroy the hive, because of a flat maxvalue. I have fixed this in the link below, plus some hive images that didn't load before. Feel free to play whatever version you think I should be judged upon. \n\n**Game link2:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3qNwrOqvxw5aU9YMHVpSlFmR1U/view?usp=sharing\n\nThe game is called Leafcutters.\nIt's a resource management/Idle game where you have to build the biggest ant hive. As I didn't have time to implement an endgoal, it could be an idea to see how big you can get the hive in for example 10, 20 or 30 minutes.\n\nThis is my first time joining Ludum Dare. I finished, even though I had a lot of ideas I had to scrap.\n\nI don't have much experience in programming, but I'm learning. I have just started learning Unity, but don't have the skills to program in C# yet. That's why I have made this in Delphi, beacuse I have some Pascal knowledge.\n\n**Programs:** Delphi 10 Seattle, MS Paint, Gimp.\n\n![Capture_02.JPG](///raw/bc9/3/z/70d.jpg)\n\n**Tips:**\n* You can overpopulate your hive by manually clicking the egghatching activation button.\n* Always have plenty of builders, to keep expanding your hive, and not reach population limit.\n* Check if operations are running (green button). Some operations like evolve and fungalgarden will pause if you reach population limit or run out of resources.\n* Get rid of the waste. Assign Mediae ants to carry out waste from the fungalgarden. If the waste level gets too high, a small part of your hive will collapse. (Waste produces more waste)\n* The more ants you have of a certain caste, the faster they will evolve into the next tier. Don\u2019t hesitate to pause evolutions, if you need a lot of a certain caste.\n* \u201cWhere are the enemies?\u201d Lucky you, I didn\u2019t have time to implement threats to the hive, that the major ants should fight of. That means the main focuses of the game are; Don\u2019t reach population limit, don\u2019t get too much waste, don\u2019t run out of resources.\u0000", "love": 0, "name": "Leafcutters", "parent": 9405, "author": 14795, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T08:04:32Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T17:30:52Z", "slug": "leafcutters", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 50952, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 4, "published": "2017-04-23T22:03:21Z", "link": {"author": [14795]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/leafcutters", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-25T09:04:16Z", "type": "item", "id": 21154}

I pushed out a small update that adds a button to the main menu for toggling fullscreen mode on and off. Hopefully that makes the game more playable for our 720p friends. \n\nAlthough nothing else was changed and it might still be fair to judge, I made a separate link for it just in case.\n\n[**TinyTerraformer 1.1a Download (Fullscreen Edition)**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-15MZLwYpKFWjlucHFjU3M0WkU)", "love": 0, "name": "Tiny Terraformer", "parent": 9405, "author": 15129, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T08:41:07Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T08:22:00Z", "slug": "tiny-terraformer", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67793, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 2, "published": "2017-04-24T10:20:49Z", "link": {"author": [15129]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/tiny-terraformer", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-24T22:24:08Z", "type": "item", "id": 21291}

Use it to pick up/place torches, chop trees and make torches from chopped trees.\nMove the camera around with mouse to screen edges and zoom in/out with mouse wheel.\n\nNote: \n\nThe game contains several bugs..

I've always wanted to make a space-themed game. We learned how to mix 2D and 3D for the first time, using different z-indexes to layer views. We played around with scriptable objects to tailor events to the user, and attempted to get the UI as text-free as possible to convey things easier and more intuitively. As we ran out of time at the end, I resorted to throwing in a few text boxes with instructions, but I'm confident that if I were to work on this again in the future I could make some fancy animated prefabs with some slick new icons to improve the way you interact with the hazards and ships.\n\n> The thing that took the most time was the panning of space when you're looking through your telescope. Finding the edge of the sprite, and clamping the camera to those bounds was a bit of a blocker, until I realised I had to funnel my values through three different spatial systems - local, to world, to camera view points! D'oh! At the very least, smooth interpolation of the movement there helped create a space-atmosphere.\n\n> The main thing we drew from this jam was architecture-related. We kept the organisation of our controllers unified and consistent, using privacy more efficiently and creating utility classes to help switch between views like a state machine. I would love to delve further into Unity components that help simplify these operations, as I've seen people at my company sitting with screens full of arrows and boxes before - there must be a reason!\n\n> I also learned how to build for web, and how to deploy the game to an online service. This was easy-peasy, and I can't be more impressed with Itch's service.\n\n**Please let me know what you think!** If anyone would like to take a peek at the source code let me know.\n\n![real-footer.png](///raw/45a/2/z/1c51.png)", "love": 0, "name": "Space Keeper", "parent": 9405, "author": 10836, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T10:51:30Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T20:24:45Z", "slug": "space-lighthouse", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 66668, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-23T22:01:51Z", "link": {"author": [10836]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/space-lighthouse", "type": "item", "id": 21706}

It was better overal compared to last ludum dare which took about 5 hours. Also scoped down the design a lot too. Maybe the theme was better this time for me.\n- Ready to code. I had several libraries that I wrote for myself in my github and was ready to be used in any kind of game. It saved me tons of time. \n- Used to engine. I used cocos2d-x engine and I'm quite used to this engine and had no other issue with it while the jam.\n- Art. I used tower defense game called 'Kingdom Rush' as a reference. It was first time to create non-pixelart style asset since 2013, so I had a bit struggle to even follow the reference's style but I think the result turned out quite nice than I expected for programmer art.\n![artImprovement.png](///raw/4cd/z/26ae.png)\nSome improvements of art style over time in same day.\n\nWhat went wrong  \n- Sleep schedule. I worked 12 ~ 16 hours straight during the weekend and messed up my sleep schedule. At the end of development, my brain was fried for most of the time and my performance was awful.\n- I spent too much time for art assets. Well, in my defense, I found myself enjoying drawing little tiny buildings and UI icons. I just couldn't stop. \n- There were too many little features required to make game at least playable. I had  to implement little features here and there which took some time.\n- Audio part of the game wasn't ready at all and wasn't able to add all the sound effects in the game in time.\n\nWhat can I improve  \n- Take time and get ready for jam. Gather free resources that can be used in any game like button sound.\n- Sleep well. Eat \n- The game was too big for solo dev.

{"body": "![new.gif](///raw/da8/1/z/23d7.gif)\n\n------\n\n**Build and Control drones as you manage your own little chunk of space!**\n\n------\n\nHey there! This is my entry for LD38. It was a lot of fun to participate.\n\nI didn't get anywhere near as done as I would have liked. There's honestly not much game to be played. But not much is still something! A lot of the core mechanics exist in code but aren't really fleshed out. But know that anything that works is legit!\n\nAnyway... the intention of this game is to be somewhat of a **civ management/resource collection game. You are a drone operator managing a small floating piece of land in space known as a \"spacechunk\"**. These chunks of space have become valuable as resource pools and farms, so companies hire operators like you to deploy drones to manage them.\n\nOnce you load in, you'll find yourself looking at your chunk, a drone, and a console. **You can use this console to send commands to your drones**. By default your home base receives these messages, but you can link to drones in order to give them tasks. The drones can be used to harvest resources around the chunk. Just click the blocks you want to collect, and send the \"harvest\" command to a drone.\n\nNow, I was hoping to have more, but currently it's only drones and crystals. But with the framework I built, I can build more tools like turrets and fighters. The intention was to also add enemies to harass and destroy your facilities, which would have definitely made this somewhat of a game.\n\nEither way, I hope you check out **S P A C E C H U N K**, even if it's just to enjoy my original (bad) music or really cool title screen. Thanks!\n\n------\n\n**ITCH.IO LINK: ** https://nonameghost.itch.io/s-p-a-c-e-c-h-u-n-k\n\n\u200b**POST JAM \u200b\u200b\u200bCHANGE LOG:**\n- Added dialog to let you know when you've done everything.(Spoiler: There's not a lot to show)\n- Changed visually intense splash screen color to something less brutal on the eyes.\n- Fixed bug that would prevent crystals from being collected.\n\n------\n\n**HOW TO PLAY:**\n\n- Click the text input under the console to type.\n- You send commands in the format \"/command\". Type \"/help\" to see the available commands.\n- You will have a drone by default, but you can build a new one using \"/build drone\".\n- Drones cost resources to build. You can view your inventory by typing \"/inv\"\n- In order to send commands to a drone, you need to connect to it. Type \"/link name\", replacing name with the 4 character name above the drone.\n- Once you're linked with a drone, you can use drone-specific commands. Type \"/help\" again to see these commands.\n- Drones can be used to harvest those pink crystals, click on the crystals you want to mine and type \"/harvest\"\n\nYou can move the console by dragging the title bar, and minimize by clicking the button there.\nYou can move the camera with WASD(Movement), QE(Rotation), and the scollwheel(zoom).\n\n------\n\n**THANKS SO MUCH FOR CHECKING IT OUT**\n\n**Twitter:** https://twitter.com/NoNameGhost\n\n------\n\n**SCREENSHOTS:**\n![Capture.PNG](///raw/da8/1/z/2214.png)\n![Captur2e.PNG](///raw/da8/1/z/2216.png)\n![afwag.PNG](///raw/da8/1/z/2219.png)\n![ergs.PNG](///raw/da8/1/z/23de.png)\n![dawfda.PNG](///raw/da8/1/z/2207.png)\n", "love": 0, "name": "S P A C E C H U N K", "parent": 9405, "author": 6317, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-22T12:42:05Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T01:06:11Z", "slug": "s-p-a-c-e-c-h-u-n-k", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67317, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 4, "published": "2017-04-25T02:02:32Z", "link": {"author": [6317]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/s-p-a-c-e-c-h-u-n-k", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-26T03:31:28Z", "type": "item", "id": 21976}

Each sector you control gives you one point, and owning three-in-a-row \u00e0 la Tic-Tac-Toe provides two more points, adding strategy to what sectors you select.

How? By throwing it asteroids with a magnet-satellite!\n\nThe game controls are:\n* Player 1: \n            A, D (Rotate your magnet).\n            W (Repel force), S (attract force).\n            Left shift (user power-up)\n            or\n            Xbox 360 Controller Joystick (Move Magnet)\n            R1 (Repel force), S (attract force) R1+L1 (use power-up)\n\n* Player 2: \n            Left arrow, Right arrow (Rotate your magnet).\n            Forward arrow (Repel force), Backward arrow (attract force).\n            Right ctrl (user power-up)\n            or\n            Xbox 360 Controller Joystick (Move Magnet)\n            R1 (Repel force), S (attract force) R1+L1 (use power-up)\n\n- Power-ups:\n\n**+The green asteroids** will provide you a shield which will block the next hit onto your planet. To acquire it attract it to your planet so it touches it. This power up needs no button input, is automatic.\n\n**+The blue asteroids** will provide you the freeze power which will stop the movement of the asteroids you hit with the magnet in the first second of use, and will let you group them to shoot them together later by repeling them. You want to use it around yourself in circles as fast as posible to not loose that first second freeze effect. YOU NEED TO HOLD THE POWER-UP BUTTON WHILE USING FREEZE.\n\n**+The red asteroids** will provide you the black hole power which will let you spawn a black hole in front of you that will do nothing untill 5 seconds later, that's when it will turn static where it is and start attracting every asteroid around. You want to time it so you send this to your opponent in the right moment, but be careful or you will be the one destroyed.\n\nWe know the controls seem so difficult at the beggining but that is part of the game (really, it is), but once you learn how to manage the repel and attract mechanics you will own your friends in this game. You can also just throw a black hole to them. lol.\n\nWe also had the idea to add different menu and in-game songs, and we made it play a random song from the list, this way you won't get tired of the same song over and over :)\n\n* This game was made by:\n\n      Carlos Eloy Jose Sanz.\n      Ceferino P\u00e9rez Cancio.\n      Sergio Cobos Galv\u00e1n.\n      David Carvajal Herv\u00e1s. Twitter: https://twitter.com/David14Carvajal\n\nWe (at least the programmer, Eloy) intend to continue adding power ups to the game because we feel it needs it.\nIt is our first Ludum Dare and it was a lot of fun :D\n\n**Sound**  We didn't make the music nor the sound in the game, but they are all royalty free audio (as far as we know).

Make sure you secure that power up!\n- Mid lane is good for sneaking units in.\n\n\n### Credits:\nThis is our first game jam and LD. I joined on the 22nd and did all the coding from scratch.

{"body": "Since this is our first participation in a Ludum Dare event we are not really sure how to actually submit a game. Thus, I will just try it through here, let's see how that goes... \n\nAnyway, about this game... In \"Atlas\", you own a small house ontop of a turtle that is surfing through the milky way. But, as life goes, you soon find yourself under the attack of Aliens, Meteors and other invaders from outer space, all trying to destroy your precious home. Try to survive as long as you can!\n\nWe thought pretty long about if Atlas was the right idea or if it even fulfilled the theme \"A small world\" in the first place. But ultimately, we decided to go along with it. A turtle is relatively small after all, is it not? Imagine this as a metaphor about you having to defend your own small world, like a room, a workspace or your circle of friends against all the dangers from outside. Changes, your boss, your parents trying to get you to clean up that beautiful chaos you have grown to love so much. Or, you know, hust imagine it as a turtle surfing through space. That works too. \n\nDeveloping this game was not easy at all. Inexperienced as we are, we completely overloaded the concept, not really realizing our mistakes until Sunday evening. But hey, that's why we participated in the first place, now we (hopefully) know how to prevent this in the future. (Inb4 I type the exact same text in my LD#39 Entry...). Also, I really need to learn how Quaternions work...\n\nCATEGORY OPT-OUTS\nWe did not create the sound files used in this game.

{"body": "![Screenshot of Giant Steps game](///raw/9a6/2/z/14fb.png)\n\n*Giant Steps* is a puzzle game in a hexagonally-tiled world. Climb over hexagonal columns and rearrange blocks to reach the exit.\n\n## Links\n\n**Play online on itch.io:** https://lennartjansson.itch.io/giant-steps\n\n**Windows build download:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/r0cq84revgn28hm/GiantStepsBuildLastDay.zip?dl=0\n\n**Source download:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/ubiuvlbre1tb78w/GiantStepsGame.zip?dl=0\n\n## About\n\nThe idea for this game began with the feeling I wanted to create something involving a hexagonal grid. I could not think of a game in which the player issues direct movement commands to a character constrained to a hex grid. So, hoping it was at least somewhat novel, I ran with that idea and brought in a familiar block-carrying puzzle element.\n\nForemost, Giant Steps is an homage to [Brandon Sterner's *Block Dude*](http://www.detachedsolutions.com/puzzpack/blockdude.php), a TI calculator game that delighted me and friends for many hours in middle school math classes. I owe much to that game -- with the exception of some of the later puzzles, Giant Steps is more or less just Block Dude in three dimensions, with more hexagons :)\n\nThe name \"Giant Steps\" is a reference to the geological formation of [Giant's Causeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway) in Northern Ireland, a dramatic landscape of hexagonal basalt pillars that juts out into the North Atlantic. The shape and texture of the basalt columns was a visual inspiration for this game.\n\nThe name is also a nod to the brilliant [John Coltrane album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Steps) of the same name, which I listened to repeatedly during the development of this game.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThank you to Cary Yang, who playtested an early version with ten puzzles on Saturday night and caught a broken puzzle.\n\nOtherwise, this was a solo project. I used Unity 5.6 as game engine and development environment, and Inkscape and Blender for assets.

{"body": "# Description\n\n## Gameplay\n\nIota Nor is a unique survival action puzzler where the user is tasked with flipping tiles on a playing field in order to prevent the spread of black tiles. Tiles are flipped simultaneously in randomized groupings of two.\n\n## Controls\n\n- **Mouse** \u00bb [Align pieces.]\n- **Left Click** \u00bb [Place pieces.]\n- **M** \u00bb [Mute music.]\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![S1.png](///raw/851/z/e77.png)\n\n## Pro Strategy\n\n- **Bonus points** \u00bb The level of difficulty increases after twenty seconds spent on the same level. Clearing the board also increases the level, and rewards a massive score bonus.\n- **Piece origin** \u00bb The dots on the pieces indicate the piece origin.

{"body": "![Cover.jpg](///raw/7b2/3/z/1381.jpg)\n\nThe Little Llama was a game created for the Ludum Dare 38 game jam by a team of 3. You play as a llama on a journey to find itself by solving puzzles using its telekinetic abilities.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ. Why a llama?\n\nA, Why not a llama?\n\n\nQ. How long did you spend on this game?\n\nA. We were supposed to spend 72 hours on it, but it was actually closer to 24.\n\n\nQ. Did you guys model everything on one of those fancy 3D softwares like 3ds Max?\n\nA. No. We used MagicaVoxel for everything. It's like Minecraft but we can export to Unity.\n\n\nQ. The game sounds terrible. Couldn't you guys find better sound assets to use?\n\nA. We personally made those sound assets with love and take offense to you saying that they sound terrible.\n\n\nQ. How was the team structured?\n\nA. We had one programmer, one artist, and one designer. The designer was fairly useless so he was turned into an artist.\n\n\nQ. How does the game relate to the theme?\n\nA. Well, you know how people say \"Wow it's a small world\" when they run into someone that knows someone they know? The idea behind this was that the llama you play as was off looking for itself. In the end, it found that it was itself all along and there was no need to look for it. \n\n\nQ. Why is none of that explained in the game?\n\nA. We had a lack of time/sleep/energy drinks. 'Nuff said. \n\nQ.

The first pixel to shrink to zero pixels is the winner, or the first pixel to grow to 200 pixels is the loser. \n\nListen for clues. If you hear \"up\", you'll want to bounce off the top wall to shrink in size. Be careful though - every time you bang into the wrong wall, you'll grow.\n\n**Pixel 1 controls:**\n* `W` -- move forward (guess which way forward is)\n* `A` --  rotate clockwise\n* `D` -- rotate anti-clockwise\n \n**Pixel 2 controls:**\n\n* `\u2191` -- move forward (guess which way forward is)\n* `\u2190` -- rotate clockwise\n* `\u2192` -- rotate anti-clockwise\n\n\nThe game is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/leereilly/PIXEL-DUEL). Pull requests are welcome if you'd like to make it better. I mean, it can't really get any worse! \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n**Known bugs:** - I forgot to hire a QA person\n\n1. Takes a while to load (hello image optimization / audio compression)\n2. Controls don't feel quite right.\n3. New game fails to load on win condition - gets stuck in an \u221e loop.\n4.

Should one of the superposed particles collide with an obstacle, the superposition collapses to the state where you survived.\n\n![pretty_cool_mechanic_eh.png](///raw/9ce/5/z/2a0.png)\n\n### Downloads\nDownloads for Windows, Linux, and OSX are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-tWgk96isz4OHBBWWNiWmZUek0?usp=sharing), along with the source code and unity project.

Feel free to skip.\n\nThis is my second game jam, and second time doing LDJam. I'm quite pleased with how this entry turned out, so I hope everyone enjoys it. As per usual, I decided to be insane and learn an entire engine during the jam: it was my first time using GameMaker.\n\nJust to explain the take on the theme in case anyone misses it: Becky works so much that her entire world is her job. It's a very very small world. Only her, the coffee, a computer and some staplers. :( Outside of that, taking the theme literally, the original size of all the assets (and the game) is a tiny 189x125.\n\nI wanted to also try out using a different pixel style, palette, and using a palette restriction.\n\nEverything was created during the jam, except for the music/sounds, which was provided by others.

In Puddle Jumper, passengers have taken instant gratification to the extreme and now expect to be ferried between destinations in just seconds. As a new airline your business model adjusts airfare based on the time it takes to reach a destination. The faster the passengers arrive at their destination, the more you get paid. Passengers waiting too long at an airport will give up and leave, costing you potential income and slowing your progress towards becoming the world's fastest and biggest airline.\n\n### How to play\n- Select a plane by left-clicking on it or pressing the numbers 1 to 4 on your keyboard.\n- Tell the selected plane where to go by right-clicking a city.\n- Cities spawn on the map and start with consecutive letters (the first are A, B, and C).\n- Passengers spawn at each city and are represented by a letter appearing above the city. The letter lets you know which city they are heading to.\n- When a plane has room and it is at a city, passengers will get on the plane (and their letters will appear above the plane).\n- Fly the plane to a city.\n- While flying planes use fuel.\n- Passengers turn from green to red as they get impatient. Passengers waiting at a city will leave if they get too impatient.\n- Passengers pay you for the trip once they arrive at the destination.

Click on buttons with the mouse to interact with them (Controls are shown in the first of the pictures below). Hold Esc to quit the game.\n\nI'm mainly experimenting with a couple of things this jam: \n\nFirst is procedural generation of levels to create a large amount of visual variety with a small number of assets. I'm a programmer, so I want to use that skill set to develop the look of my game. On top of that I'm going with 3D because I feel like simple art goes much farther in 3D rather then 2D, at least for me.\n\nSecond is making something that could potentially work with VR (Though I haven't ported it to any headset yet).\n\nThird I didn't want to rely on any combat mechanics. Instead I wanted to focus on the environment of the game and light exploration. The game doesn't have any action, or score or anything of that nature as I feel that I too often make the same kind of \"Arcadey\" thing every jam.\n\nLastly, I'm going for a design style where I get the framework for the game in very quickly, and leave myself the majority of the time adding in polish. A simple framework with lots of flexibility means that I will have something by the end of the jam no matter what, and I can have something playable at any stage of the process.\n\nI hope you all enjoy the game!\n\n(PS. I Can't guarantee that the game will run well on most PCs. I only have mine to test it on, and it does a lot of rendering. If it turns out to run slow on a good number of machines, I can put out a post-compo version which culls some of details to make it run a little better.

Playing on a mobile device is a Bad Idea&nbsp;(tm).\n\n# Assets and Licenses\n\nThis project was a final exam for myself, to see if I could put together a playable game in Unreal Engine within Ludum Dare's timeline. I did not have time to polish up the art or to create original audio. The visuals are a combination of mouse-drawn sprites and public domain images, the music is from the incomparable [Kevin MacLeod](incompetech.com), and the sound effects are public domain and from the Unreal Engine Starter Kit. I originally submitted the game in the Compo, but because I ended up using these third-party assets, I've switched over to the Jam.\n\n# Screenshots\n\nTitle Screen:\n![title.png](///raw/625/1/z/843.png)\n\nIn Game Action:\n![in-game.png](///raw/625/1/z/8fd.png)\n\n", "love": 0, "name": "Subpar Melee", "parent": 9405, "author": 5414, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-23T17:17:35Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T13:57:33Z", "slug": "subpar-melee", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 65625, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-23T23:05:41Z", "link": {"author": [5414]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/subpar-melee", "type": "item", "id": 24733}

The planets and the stars, colossal giants drifting through space, thinking they're so great. It's time for the status quo to change in a gripping adventure full of romance, betrayal and 16th century colloquialisms.

It's still pretty fun though!\n\n## Controls:\n\nMove your **mouse** around the asteroid and **click** to move towards your mouse pointer.\n\nYour impulse towards that point depends on how far away you **click**!\n\nCollide with **stellar objects** (such as asteroids) to absorb them.\n\nAbsorb **stellar objects** with a smaller **mass** than you to gain their **mass**!\n\nTry to absorb an object that's larger than you, however, and it'll be **game over**...\n\n## Endgame:\n\nUnfortunately, the game has no tear-jerking finale. However, do post the highest mass you obtain in the comments below and you can compare it to one of these many real life stellar objects:\n\n* Alpha Centauri: \n  * 2.2E+30 kg\n* R135a1 (Most massive star):\n  * 6.3E+32 kg\n* Min Supermassive Black Hole:\n  * 2.0E+35 kg\n* Max Supermassive Black Hole:\n  * 1.0E+41 kg\n\n## Ending Remarks\n\nThis is probably the most polished and complete game I have produced for Ludum Dare and in the shortest time!

Or it's a game about somebody doodling on a piece of paper pretending to be knocking planets into a black hole. It isn't really clear.\n\nThe mechanics are pretty simple. Use the mouse to aim the red planet, and try to knock the other planets into the center black hole. Dotted lines will show up to predict the path of the planets for some time in the future. If the red planet lands in the black hole, you lose the game. Getting more than one planet into the black hole in one turn will give you point bonuses. If you don't get any in the black hole on a given turn, you lose some points.\n\n## Links\n - Download (Mac/Windows/Linux): [https://benjamin-l.itch.io/interplanetary-billiards](https://benjamin-l.itch.io/interplanetary-billiards)\n - Source Code: [https://github.com/Benjamin-L/ld38](https://github.com/Benjamin-L/ld38)\n", "love": 0, "name": "Interplanetary Billiards", "parent": 9405, "author": 2369, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-23T21:36:44Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T06:45:36Z", "slug": "interplanetary-billiards", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 47742, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 1, "published": "2017-04-24T06:17:27Z", "link": {"author": [2369]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/interplanetary-billiards", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-24T08:06:39Z", "type": "item", "id": 25229}

{"body": "![timeWars.PNG](///raw/dd2/6/z/e17.png)\nThis is a game about the many battles for control of Europe throughout time.  The idea of this game is that all of these nations are competing to own the \"Old World.\"  There just isn't enough room for all of these factions.  This is a battle simulator-type game that is designed to somewhat accurately represent the fighting styles and abilities of the nations that existed.  For example, the Romans are very disciplined, and only attack if they are sure they will hit.  The Spartans are incredibly strong and will hold off anyone who goes after them.  Many more stats and modifiers like these are included.  This game has full controller support (Ideally Xbox,) and also has keyboard and mouse support.  With hand-to-hand combat, there is a decently high skill ceiling for fighting enemies, and some nations are developed enough to use guns, such as Britain and Prussia.  Britain does more damage, but Prussia can fire faster.  This game also contains various cheat codes for godmode and infinite attack speed.  The game is not meant to handle maximum of every unit, but if you think your computer can handle it, feel free to give it a try.

When you, a fat and red pinguin come to life, the community feels threatened in its foundations and need to react. How ? By slapping, pushing and killing you of course !\n\nWill you choose to sacrifice yourself for the common good and take your life ? Will you fight for righteousness and open-mindedness ? Will you wait impassively until they finally kick you out ? Let's find out !\n\n\n__Pinguin biology 101__\n\n- they can __move__ (asdf);\n- they can __jump__ (space);\n- they can __slap__ (left mouse click);\n- they __can't fly__: falling of the platform is equal to a painful death;\n- moving too much make them dizzy. After a while (_green bar full_), it might make them __puke fish__ hard enough to eject others;\n- they are resistant, but have a limit in how much slaps they can take. Too many hits (_red bar full_) and they __faint__ for a while.\n\n_Notes_: \n\n- ony big pinguins (you) have motion thickness.\n- small pinguins (not you) faint after only one slap.\n- pinguins are stubborn: when they want something (your head), they won't let go.\n\n \n## Screenshots\n\n![ScreenShot1.jpg](///raw/64e/1/z/26db.jpg)\n![ScreenShot2.jpg](///raw/64e/1/z/26dc.jpg)\n![ScreenShot3.jpg](///raw/64e/1/z/26dd.jpg)\n![ScreenShot4.jpg](///raw/64e/1/z/26de.jpg)\n\n## Credits\n\n_Programmers_: Lucy Linder, Yann Piller, C\u00e9lin Chassot\n\n_Artists_: Naomi Favre, Alexis Simonetta\n\nMade with \u2764 in Switzerland\n", "love": 0, "name": "Iceburg", "parent": 9405, "author": 7750, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-23T22:47:54Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T20:47:05Z", "slug": "iceburg", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 66735, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T21:47:53Z", "link": {"author": [7750, 26295, 10763, 26299, 10760]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/iceburg", "type": "item", "id": 25379}

{"body": "![Screen01.jpg](///raw/1d/z/9f2.jpg)\n\n**The idea**\nIt has often been said that internet and travelling has made the world smaller. So I have made a travelling game, of course with a small twist.\n\n**The story**\nA planet very long away, has invented their first flying machine. It's a good old-fashioned UFO.\n\nYou are the only pilot of this planet. Therefore you must transport all the passengers of this planet alone. But beware it is not good if any of the planet's airports overflows.\n\n**The rules**\nThe goal for this game is to fly the the planet's passengers to the place that they want to visit. You've lost the game when just one of the airports gets overcrowded.\n\n**The Controls**\nThis game is controlled with the mouse. \n- To rotate camera press the right mouse button and move the mouse. \n- If you hover the mouse over an airport in the HUD, the world rotates toward the airport. Click on airport in HUD also select this airport as the next destination.\n- Press escape to quit the game. \n\n**Helpful info**\n- When your UFO are in an airport the game time stops. This means that while the UFO are in an airport there will not happen any changes in the number of passengers in any of the airports. \n- Think ahead when you choose which passengers you bring to the next airport.\n\n**Used Software**\n- Unreal engine 4\n- Blender\n- GIMP 2\n- Inkscape\n- Audacity\n- LMMS\n\nGood Luck\n\n**Downloads**\n* **Win32:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/cldr1293l0r1wx2/SpaceTravel15%28Win32%29.zip?dl=1\n* **Win64:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/kj3rg2bpwb9vv49/SpaceTravel15%28Win64%29.zip?dl=1\n* **Souce:** https://www.dropbox.com/s/x8k9g66ttoqpke3/TravelSmallWorls.zip?dl=1", "love": 0, "name": "Space Travel 15", "parent": 9405, "author": 209, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-23T23:44:19Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T18:21:36Z", "slug": "space-travel-15", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 66426, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 13, "published": "2017-04-24T00:16:28Z", "link": {"author": [209]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/space-travel-15", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-26T10:36:21Z", "type": "item", "id": 25497}

All you can do is devour nearby worlds by destroying their cores. Watch out! There are people living on these worlds, and they're not too happy that you're destroying them all. Most of them will avoid you, but some worlds have fearsome soldiers that can do some damage.\n\nEventually, you will starve to death. That's just how it goes being such a huge creature! You burn a lot of calories. How much destruction can you cause before you die?\n\n## Builds\n* [WebGL](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/ZkbdC8s8EM)\n* [Android](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/WJbh1Zs8VM/)\n\nPost-Compo:\nIncludes performance improvements, bug fixes, and balance tweaks:\n*  [WebGL](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/-ymqFKcPEf/)\n* [Android](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/share/ZkpW2Y5DVf/)\n\n## How to play\n\nThe controls are simple, and are designed for mobile and mouses. Drag anywhere on the screen and fling to send your monster flying. While in the air, click/tap and hold to send your monster crashing back into the nearest planet. The faster you're falling, the more damage you do, so fling yourself as high as you can before dropping again, without leaving the planet's area.\n\nOnce you hit the very core of the planet, it will explode! Everything on it will die, you'll rack up more points, and best of all, you'll satisfy a bit of your hunger. The only way to stay alive is to keep eating!\n\n## Notes\n\nThis game was made in about 18 hours of actual work. It's made in Unity.\n\nThe Android build is untested. Let me know if it doesn't work. I'd make an iOS build for everyone but provisioning.\n\nHappy to come back to Ludum Dare after years of being unable to do it.

Thanks for taking a look at my submission for the Ludum Dare 38 game jam, my first ever jam I've taken place in! The theme for this jam is \"A Small World\" and so I decided to make my game one where you have to fend off drills from destroying your little world, a task which gets harder over each of the 14 levels. This game will take a total of 9:20 if you manage to complete it (which I highly doubt as it does get very difficult). I wont say this is a good game, I wouldn't even say that this game is good for a 3-day jam, but I hope that it's acceptable.

Left click the build snowman button to build a snowman at your snow storage (the big thing at the far left of the map). Building a snowman costs 25 snowballs (your snowball amount can be seen at the top left of the screen). To increase your income build an extractor using the button at the bottom of the screen. After clicking the button click on a tile with large snowballs on it. The nearest snowman will travel to it and build the extractor if you have enough snowballs. To win the game you must destroy the enemy's snow storage (the big thing at the far right of the map) and kill all of their snowmen. To attack just position your snowmen within range of an enemy building or snowman. When attacking your snowman shooting snowballs made of his own snow, so his health will go down. To heal your snowmen travel over a tile containing what appear to be smaller snowballs. If your snowman already has quite a bit of health then you will receive snowballs for traveling over the tile. Snowball tiles do not regenerate so use them sparingly.\n\n**Authors**:\n\nTomahawk2001913: Programming and other unlisted tasks\n\nLandScrape: Art\n\nwert401: Music\n\n**Downloads**:\n\nWindows: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0t3QLbtKRHTR1RCMC1kaXVFVXM\n\nMac OSX: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0t3QLbtKRHTMi1BXzlydTA1eGs\n\nLinux: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0t3QLbtKRHTQWlNcWF4aU9hTTA\n\nAndroid (*Desktop versions are better.*): https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0t3QLbtKRHTdnQ1dE10RE1zWEE\n\nSource: https://goo.gl/gTT13g", "love": 0, "name": "The Snow Globe Conflict", "parent": 9405, "author": 3507, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-24T01:21:29Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T03:56:11Z", "slug": "the-snow-globe-conflict", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 63721, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T00:21:54Z", "link": {"author": [3507]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/the-snow-globe-conflict", "type": "item", "id": 25792}

{"body": "**RASHLANDER** is an arcade game about navigating an asteroid belt with limited fuel and the constant tug of gravity. Find the warp point in each level while collecting extra fuel by landing at fuel stations. With permadeath testing your skills, can you make it to the end of all 5 areas?\n\n\n**Know before you play:**\n\n- Controls are **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**.\n- Land on your feet, not your nose.\n- This is a *hard* game. It is meant to be difficult.\n\n**Play: ** http://www.adventurelamp.com/shared/LD/rashlander01/index.html\n\n**Twitter: ** https://twitter.com/ryguygames\n\n![gif03.gif](///raw/15f/3/z/d83.gif)\n![gif04.gif](///raw/15f/3/z/deb.gif)![gif05.gif](///raw/15f/3/z/dda.gif)\n\n**Thoughts:** This weekend I aimed to combine elements from classic games like Asteroids and Lunar Lander as well as more moderns games like Super Mario Galaxy. I also wanted the game to feel juicier and more stylized than the classics without veering out of the ultra minimal shapes of classic arcade. Working at a 320x240 resolution helped reign my options in. I am interested in continuing work on this and thinking about how I can get more interaction out of the simple mechanics currently in place (ala Downwell). A side note--the game might be super hard? I didn't have any time to get feedback from others and decided to go the permadeath route so we'll just see how that goes. I had a ton of fun making this and hope you enjoy playing.\n\n**Source:** http://www.adventurelamp.com/LD/rashlander01/rashlandersource.capx", "love": 0, "name": "RASHLANDER", "parent": 9405, "author": 16209, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-24T01:28:11Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T19:20:16Z", "slug": "rashlander", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "compo", "version": 51996, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 1, "published": "2017-04-24T01:59:42Z", "link": {"author": [16209]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/rashlander", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-24T02:23:43Z", "type": "item", "id": 25813}

{"body": "**Description:** Get the trinket at the top of the tower!  This game is too hard, leave a comment if you are able to beat it!  I think the hardest part is jumping over 4 spikes in the upper left corner - it's doable, but very difficult.  The world itself is only two screens (therefore Small World).\n\n**Controls:**  Arrow keys to move.  Z to shoot, but for now the bullets can't destroy anything.\n\n**Notes:** Sorry, I made the game too hard... all the jumps are doable and the game is winnable, but a few of the jumps are especially tough.  Also, the spike hitboxes are squares, so it might look like you clip them more than you should.  If I had time, I would figure out how to do checkpoints and maybe add levels with shootable enemies.\n\n\n**Production:** Music was made in around an hour using FL Studio, and will be up on my soundcloud later.  Also, I didn't have time to make art, so please enjoy the placeholder animated sprite!\n\nI also spent a lot of time figuring out how to make strafing backwards while shooting work when you hold both arrows, but because of time constraints, I didn't get to design interesting enemies to shoot.\n\nFinally did one good run and got 48 seconds!

But the ADULTS see through your clever Groucho Marx disguise and all hell breaks loose.\n\nThe neighbourhood POLICE FORCE are on the hunt for an underage purchaser; meanwhile the presence of police officers has forced THE HOMELESS to find a new street to live on, and they blame you! PARENTS are on the lookout, wanting to protect their kids from your bad influence. GOLF BUGGY DRIVERS from the local golf course are also on high alert.\nNot to mention, you still have to send out the invites...\n\n**CONTROLS & GAMEPLAY:**\n\nSee our itch.io page!\n\n**THEME:**\n\nThe theme for the 38th Ludum Dare Game Jam was 'A Small World'. We wanted to pursue a creative interpretation, and thus decided our 'small world' would be where you bump into someone by coincidence in a situation you wouldn't expect, and you say 'Wow, what are you doing here??? What a small world!'. In our game, our kid uses a fake ID to buy some alcohol for a party the following night, but must avoid the suspicion of adults encountered the night before whilst travelling home from school. This 'small world phenomenon' can thus be seen as the 'enemy' of our game's protagonist.\n\n**CREDITS:**\n\nArt: Hyungbin Kang, Peter Gietl\n\nCode / Game Design / Writing: Xavier Ekkel (my first game jam!

You build units and barracks with resources gathered from control points scattered around the map.\n\nBut remember, both the control points and your initial base position will disapper if you don't pay tribute to the Consumer of Worlds.\n\nIf you gather enough mana, the scales will tip and your side of the map will be destroyed more slowly.

Their entrance there made the place unstable, and some time rifts started to crack around, through which some monsters are trying to invade and eat the interns. Now it\u2019s in your hands to help them defend themselves and repair the time machine to get back to the agency HQ\u2026 before Jack finds out, preferably.\n\nThe quadruple twins are strong and able combatants. They may defend the rifts against the monsters. They may also mine the crystal necessary to repair the Time Machine (luckily those are abundant on the Rift World!). Be careful to make them Rest a bit if they get too injured, so they can recover.\n\nThe impetuous Alja is the leader of the team, because she is the only one with more than two months of experience on the agency. She will provide valuable help on mining and repairing.\n\nThe shy Nick is the genius of the team. He will research the way of getting out of Rift World. Also, he can repair the Rifts if the monsters are close to getting in, and also medics the injured combatants.\n\nIf the Rifts don\u2019t get defended the monsters will start ripping them open apart. That will allow them to enter the dimension and then nothing will be able to stop them eating our little interns as a hard-to-digest lunch. Don\u2019t let that happen, by defending and repairing them.\n\nTo win you need to repair the Time Machine and get out! Setting Nick to Research will do the job, but it takes time and resources\u2026 and sometimes Nick will be needed somewhere else.\n\nMining is important - the crystal is used for repairing the Rifts and for the Research to get out of that damn place.

Place you device horizontally in a steady surface.\n2. Put your index and middle fingers on top of the giant's feet.\n3. Alternatively touch and drag backwards the feet of the giant simulating a treadmill. \n4. The shadow of the giant will show you where the other foot will be placed in the next step.\n5. Avoid stepping on people and try to dodge vehicles crashing into your legs. \n6. If you take too long to make the step, you'll lose balance.\n\nExample:\n        - Touch LEFT foot, drag backwards to define RIGHT foot step position, release LEFT foot.\n        - Touch RIGHT foot, drag backward to define LEFT foot step position, release RIGHT foot.\n        - Touch LEFT foot, ...\n\n![Game3_explain.png](///raw/696/6/z/1a31.png)\n\n![End.PNG](///raw/696/6/z/11fb.png)\n\nHave fun! \n\nP.S: If you are playing on Windows, simulate touch&drag using mouse click and movement.\n\n## Category Opt-outs\n\nMost of our assets are not original:\n\n- 3D Models: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/50095\n- Particle Effects: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/50095\n- Music game: https://youtu.be/Cypt-gdj1fg\n- Music menu: https://youtu.be/sLYBkdbIvLw\n- Sounds: Several sources on the internet, can't remember (sorry about that)  \n\n## Links\n\nWindows (EXE): [Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6lIlNc6C9fCNFNPaWdqd1F4OUU)\n\nAndroid (APK): [Download](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6lIlNc6C9fCd05maHB0X2lTek0)\n\nSource code: [git clone...](https://bitbucket.org/dlobo/ld38)\n", "love": 0, "name": "Crazy People, Friendly Giant", "parent": 9405, "author": 26262, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-24T10:19:13Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T00:41:04Z", "slug": "crazy-people-friendly-giant", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 58475, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T10:51:43Z", "link": {"author": [26262, 13302, 26272, 13262]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/crazy-people-friendly-giant", "type": "item", "id": 26264}

{"body": "![IMG-20170424-WA0013.jpg](///raw/71/z/12a5.jpg)\n## Fraser Island: A game of bluff and greed\n\nI was away on holiday during this LD but wanted to make a game anyway - so I made a card game! The game is played using a standard 52-card pack of cards. The game has only been playtested with two players, but should extend to more players.\n\nThe rules of the game are thus:\n\n### Story\nYou (Player 1) are a seasoned diamond miner, and you arrive on Fraser Island with other miners as there have been reports of magnificent diamonds being dug out here. You immediately spot your arch-rival (Player 2) and optionally other rivals (Players 3 to n).\n\n\"Of course you would be here\", you say. \"It's a small world\" comes the reply.\n\nHowever, after some more chat, you decide to put your differences aside and in stead team up in order to beat the rest of the miners to the best diamonds, and maybe even find the legendary Ace of Diamonds. \n\nYou agree to evenly share all diamonds found, but anything else of value is for each to keep. You also agree that the penalty for hiding a diamond is confiscation of all private assets, and the penalty for hiding the legendary Ace of Diamonds is death.\n\nOf course, in secret, you think you might be able to pocket a diamond or two for yourself despite the agreement...\n\n### Aim\nThe goal of the game is to accumulate more wealth than any other player.\n\n### Wealth\nAt the end of the game, each card in each player's private pile is worth thus:\n\n* Each \u2665 is some minor valuable (called \"money\") worth $1.\n* Each numeric \u2666 is a small diamond and worth the numeric value in $ (eg. 5\u2666 is worth $5).\n* J\u2666, Q\u2666 and K\u2666 are big diamonds and worth $50 each.\n* The legendary A\u2666 is a massive diamond worth $100.\n\n### Starting the game\nEach player draws 5 cards into their hand. Do not show the cards to your opponent(s).\n\n### Turn\nLooping clockwise from a randomly selected starting player, each player takes a turn. A turn goes like this:\n\nYou go mining for diamonds. The outcome of the mining depends on which card you play and/or what you choose to tell the other players. \n\nSelect a card from your hand and play it. You play it by either putting it face down on top of your private pile - or face up on top of the public discard pile. Anything played in the public pile is shared with the other players, eg. if you find a diamond you are supposed to declare it here. You can also choose to play it into your private pile, at which point it goes face down on top of the pile. You then need to tell the other players which card you played. You may choose to lie/bluff at this point.\n\nAfter you have played a card, draw another one. \n\n### Card types\n* \u2660 denotes dirt.\n* \u2663 denotes trees.\n* \u2665 denotes money.\n* \u2666 denotes diamonds.\n\n### End\nThe game ends when a player draws the last card. Each player, starting with the player who would normally go next, can then issue a single challenge (see below) before the wealth of each player is counted. \n\n### Challenges\nAny player can at any point issue a challenge of honesty. The challenging player needs to pay a $1 fee (eg. a single \u2665 card from their hand) that is refunded if the challenge is successful. \n\nOnce a challenge has been issued, no further actions are completed until the challenge is over. If a player was halfway to putting a card into his private pile, that action is not completed. \n\nAll players (including the challenger) reveal the top 3 cards of their private pile. If any of them is a \u2666 card, the challenge is successful. That means, the $1 fee is returned to the player issuing the challenge, and all cards in the offending player's private stack are revealed and added to the public discard stack. If one of them is A\u2666, the offending player is removed from the game (executed).\n\nIf the challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging player loses their $1 fee (and will have to play the rest of the game with 1 less card in their hand), and they also lose some credence. If they had already lost some credence (eg. by already having made an unsuccessful challenge) they become \"a person of disrespect\" and can no longer issue challenges.\n\nNote that there are no limits on how many challenges a player can issue as long as they are successful.\n\nAlso note that a \"person of disrespect\" can still participate and even win the game - they just can't issue challenges.\n\nFinally note that if a player puts a card in his private pile and says \"I found a diamond\" then any player (except persons of disrespect) can challenge them without paying the $1 fee and without penalty (e.g. without losing credence if unsuccessful).\n\n### Example play\n* Player 1 and player 2 each draw 5 cards each\n* Player 1 starts and plays a card (9\u2666) into his private pile and says \"I found some dirt\" (i.e. he is bluffing). Then he draws a card.\n* Player 2 plays a card (5\u2665) into his private pile and says \"I found some money\", and draws a card.\n* Player 1 plays a card (4\u2665) and says \"I too found some money\" and draws a card.\n* Player 2 plays 3\u2666 to the public pile (face up) and draws a card.\n* Player 1 plays a card (6\u2660) to his private pile and says \"I found some dirt\" and draws a card.\n* Player 2 plays 7\u2663 to his private pile, says \"found trees\" and draws a card.\n* Player 2 then chooses to challenge player 1, and pays with 7\u2665 from his hand. \n* Player 1 reveals the top 3 cards from his private pile (6\u2660, 4\u2665, 9\u2666). He was hiding a diamond - so his entire private pile (including any cards under the top 3) goes into the public discard pile. He now has $0 value in his private pile. Player 2 gets his fee (7\u2665) back and can still challenge at least twice more before the game is over. He has $1 value in his private pile (from 5\u2665), and if player 1 challenged him he would be fine as he does not have any \u2666in his private pile... atleast not yet!\n\n### Extensions\nIf playing with more than 4 players, add a second pack of cards, but remove the second A\u2666 first!\n\n### Questions/comments/feedback welcome!", "love": 0, "name": "Fraser Island", "parent": 9405, "author": 23, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-24T12:10:34Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-26T00:51:23Z", "slug": "fraser-island", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 67308, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T15:28:39Z", "link": {"author": [23]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/fraser-island", "type": "item", "id": 26346}

You can mouse over the actions (and the tiles, if you have no action selected) to better understand their uses.  Every action has a cost in resources, mana above all. At every turn, you'll receive a basic amount of mana, and some buildings can help you out with that. \n\nThe gods will present some quests to you, and check upon it some days after. Failure or success will change your \"Favor\" value, which is the true goal of the game: If you reach 200, you'll win. If you reach 0, you'll lose. TO win, develop a strategy around which quests to keep, watch over your resources and balance your map.

In this game you are a robot armed with a cannon, trying to defeat your opponents. The rules are simple, you win if you are the last man(or in this case, machine) standing.\n\nThe controls are a bit tricky at first, but you get used to them really quick:\n\n You need a controller to play(any kind of controller will do, but the Interface is meant for an Xbox Controller).\n\n- Use you left joystick to move left or right.\n\n- Left trigger to use your jetpack-like boost, but you must be carefull as it overheats.\n\n- Right Trigger to shoot.\n\n- Right joystick to aim.\n\nNow here comes the tricky part. Every planet has its own gravity, so you can use the orbit of the planet you are near to to help you move through the map, but be careful, as the projectiles you shoot are also affected by gravity.\n\nSo gather up your friends(at least one of them), and get ready for a Super Galactic Gravity Battle!\n\n![Choose.PNG](///raw/7d8/6/z/1567.png)\n\n![scrrinchot1.PNG](///raw/7d8/6/z/1568.png)\n\n![scr2.PNG](///raw/7d8/6/z/1569.png)\n\n![scr3.PNG](///raw/7d8/6/z/156a.png)\n\n\n\n*there are some issues with xbox one controllers through bluetooth, cable is recommended*", "love": 0, "name": "Super Galactic Gravity Battle", "parent": 9405, "author": 26839, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-24T19:45:09Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T09:51:38Z", "slug": "super-galactic-gravity-battle", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 64940, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 2, "published": "2017-04-24T19:50:56Z", "link": {"author": [26839, 26870, 9917, 26866]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/super-galactic-gravity-battle", "notes-timestamp": "2017-04-24T20:09:27Z", "type": "item", "id": 26840}

You probably won't find out by playing this game, because we ran out of time. You should still be able to finish it (and you should not suffer to long !). Enjoy !\n\n## Download\n\n* **Windows:** Coming soon !\n* **github:** https://github.com/draklaw/ld38\n\n## Notes\n\nFinished 30 minutes late. But I had to finish alone because my teammates had to leave. They work tomorrow !\n\nWindows version should come tomorrow as well as a few pictures. I have to go to bed now !\n\nI will try to write a small walkthrough for people that would like to see the end but are too lazy to search by themselves (to be honest, it's probably not fun).\n\n**If you find a bug or the game do not start or whatever, _please_ take some time to write a comment to let us know !** If you can join the log (`log.txt`), it's even better ! **_Thanks !_**\n\n## Instructions\n\n* **Arrow keys:** move your character\n* **Space / return:** interact\n* **Escape:** quit\n\nTalk to people and grab some resources, then go to the fire to sleep and start the next day.

But it is impossible to go anywhere else because the exit is long gone. The exit zone is controlled by a giant and its comrades. As a hero of your town you should clean the dungeons and face the giant.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n![town.png](///raw/703/3/z/1a93.png)\n\n## Information\n\nWay Out is based on Ergenekon Legend (A popular Turkic Legend). Here is a brief information about Ergenekon Legend.\n\n## Ergenekon Legend\n\nIn the Turkic mythology the myth aims to explain the foundation of the Turkic Khaganate. The Ergenekon legend tells about a great crisis of the ancient Turks. Following a military defeat, the Turks took refuge in the legendary Ergenekon valley where they were trapped for four centuries. They were finally released when a blacksmith created a passage by melting rock, allowing the gray wolf Asena to lead them out. The people led out of the valley found the Turkic Khaganate, in which the valley functions as its capital. A New Year's ceremony commemorates the legendary ancestral escape from Ergenekon. The capital referred to is assumed to be Ordu-Baliq.\n\n## Game Mechanics\n\nThe Legendary Ergenekon valley is now way too small for the people living inside. \n\n- Typical Platformer\n- Dungeons with puzzles!\n- A final boss fight!\n\nSolve all the puzzles in dungeons and face the Giant!\n\n## Controls\n\nA to interact, S to attack, Arrow keys to move around.\n\n## Team\n\n- Art and Design: Bahri Sertkaya\n- Game Programming: Adil Basar\n- Theme Music: Berk Emre Sar\u0131bas\n\n## Music\n\n* If you liked the main theme, you can always listen from: https://soundcloud.com/user-695316027/way-out-ludum-dare-38", "love": 0, "name": "Way Out", "parent": 9405, "author": 13063, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-24T21:54:06Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T23:47:16Z", "slug": "way-out", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 56837, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T23:45:04Z", "link": {"author": [13063]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/way-out", "type": "item", "id": 27106}

I originally started with another friend who had to bail out after we had modeled all 3d assets for the game. Infuriated, I decided I'm gonna make a game on my own then. Changing from Unity to GameMaker, I figured out my skills would be adequate enough to create something. I found out later that I'd need some help from my brothers and decided I'm gonna replace the old friends with my bros as my new team members. The soundscape is the only part of the game that we did not create ourselves. Everything is credited according to CC rules in the credits though. I digressed from the theme a bit, but I still claim the game is about a small world, since the world of the protagonist is shrinking step by step and he's fighting against that change. This coulda been so much more awesome, had we started this when the Jam started and not 40 hours after!\n\n\nLink to .exe: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ln4vk2ut8osgolh/TheWallsAreClosingIn.exe?dl=0![2.png](///raw/55a/6/z/193f.png)", "love": 0, "name": "The Walls Are Closing In", "parent": 9405, "author": 27221, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-24T22:40:46Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-24T22:55:13Z", "slug": "the-walls-are-closing-in", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 55630, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-24T22:46:09Z", "link": {"author": [27221]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/the-walls-are-closing-in", "type": "item", "id": 27227}

{"body": "Gamejolt Link: http://gamejolt.com/games/HarryInksShrinks/252116\n\nStencyl Arcade Link: http://www.stencyl.com/game/play/36686\n\nThis is my unfinished game \"Harry Inks Shrinks.\" I didn't get to finish most of the things I wanted to do because there were many mechanics I hadn't learned. This was to show what I was able to get done.\n\nAfter a lot of brainstorming, my take on the theme \"A Small World\" was the idea of a literal small world. The premise of the game was that you were a scientist (or just some smart guy) working on a shrink ray named Harry Inks. I came up with the name \"Harry Inks\" because it's an anagram of \"Shrinkray\" which was the original weapon/tool I had in mind. The issue is that I've only made one game before and it was with a Crash Course kit that served as a tutorial for beginners (although I added a lot more than what was originally asked). Despite not having much experience I decided to see what I can do in 2 days (or 3 days, as it is now, if I couldn't make it in time for the compo). I learned a lot along the way especially with making pixel art (which I've barely done before) and I now know what's possible to do in a (busy) weekend with my current level (although proper collisions are DEFINITELY still higher). I wanted to at least add the enemies running around and the ability to shoot, but I didn't want to rush that part and accidentally break the game. I am proud to say that everything in the game was made or designed by me (even if not as much as many of the games for Ludum Dare 38. It also forced me to do a ton in a few days and I know it's possible for me to add to this game to make it how I originally planned if I work at even just a fraction as I had this weekend.\n\n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2017-04-23 a\u0300 1.25.15 AM.png](///raw/81c/2/z/2196.png) ![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2017-04-23 a\u0300 1.28.48 AM.png](///raw/81c/2/z/21e0.png)\n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2017-04-25 a\u0300 4.28.42 AM.png](///raw/81c/2/z/21e4.png) ![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2017-04-25 a\u0300 4.32.49 AM.png](///raw/81c/2/z/21fb.png)\n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2017-04-25 a\u0300 4.32.10 AM.png](///raw/81c/2/z/21fc.png)", "love": 0, "name": "Harry Inks Shrinks", "parent": 9405, "author": 11288, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-25T00:21:55Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T03:12:41Z", "slug": "harry-inks-shrinks", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 63242, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T02:27:16Z", "link": {"author": [11288]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/harry-inks-shrinks", "type": "item", "id": 27499}

Still new to Linux, perhaps it will work even if you download it. If you want to compile from scratch, you need SFML >= 2.3.2 (or something around there).\n\nMade with C++ using SFML, graphics were made in Adobe Flash. Sound was made using SFXR.\n\n\n\n#Images:\n\n[Homebase: Defence - Main Menu](http://i.imgur.com/8OgsUPt.png)\n\n[Homebase: Defence - 1 Second to Start](http://i.imgur.com/z2kIXOu.png)\n\n[Homebase: Defence - Invaders have Landed!](http://i.imgur.com/7pcYoNM.png)\n\n\n#Controls:\n\nWASD - Control your little space ship\n\n[SPACE] - Spaceship fires gun; Any cannons you built on the planet also fire, if you have enough energy\n\n[ENTER] - Launch missile (only if you built missile pads)\n\nMouse - Build buildings from the toolbar at the bottom of the screen (placement is random - enjoy!)\n\nYou can't control the planet itself (duh), so you should try to position your ship to defend its blind spot(s). You also have no limit to how far from the planet you can fly, so you should try to pick off ships well before they get to your planet.\n\nHitting an enemy ship will kill it, and respawn you at your planet, but it will cost you several times the enemy ship's value (ie. costs you money). You cannot collide with enemy ships inside a shield bubble. If an enemy ship hits one of your shield bubbles, you do not get any money.\n\n\n#Structures:\n\nCannon - Fires lasers, just like your ship. Higher rate of fire, but drains planet energy\n\nSolar Panel Array - Increases planetary energy regeneration rate\n\nMissile Launch Platform - Launches missiles (shocking, I know). They track enemy ships and the explosion does several points of damage over time\n\nShield Generator - Produces a small bubble shield around part of your planet. Enemy ships that hit it do not grant money, and drain a large-ish amount of planetary energy. Consumes energy to keep active.\n\nBattery - Increases maximum amount of planetary energy you can store at any given time.\n\n\n#Enemies:\n\nScout Ship - Very fast, aggressively charges your planet\n\nArmoured Ship - Slower version of the scout; takes more hits to kill\n\nSupport Ship - Has a shield bubble that protects all enemy ships inside it; easy kill without shields; prefers escorting carriers\n\nCarrier - Massive invasion ship; launches drop pods once it is within range of your planet; very dangerous\n\n\n#Developer Comments:\n\nMy first Ludum Dare Game! It was very fun, and I'm quite proud of it. Please give feedback (including criticism)! \n\nIt was initially going to be a Compo entry, but I ran out of time; I had a busy weekend, and I struggled a bit with this theme in terms of coming up with an idea that I would enjoy implementing that still fit in the theme. However, I still followed Compo rules - all assets were made by me, (I worked alone) and the code was written from scratch (except, of course, SFML).\n\nI ended up remaking an arcade-style \"defend the planet from the aliens\" kind of game. I'm particularly pleased with the spawning system; it has a difficulty function that keeps the game (hopefully) interesting (I say hopefully because I spent very little time play testing) and is not hard coded, so there is no maximum level.\n\nI really enjoy the art I made for this game, I'm particularly proud of it, as well as the potential complexity of the game.\n\n\n#Source Code:\n[Source Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxNdZ3qmzhI6NHNINUg4ZFE1Q0k/view?usp=sharing) (Google Drive)\n\n(Fair warning: You will likely get compiler warnings. The code slowly devolved and became very messy, I never had a chance to rewrite/refactor anything. Be warned that many variables are part of classes that they logically should not be ... It compiles, though!)", "love": 0, "name": "Homebase: Defence", "parent": 9405, "author": 17796, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-25T00:31:31Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T01:40:15Z", "slug": "homebase-defence", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 60613, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T01:40:15Z", "link": {"author": [17796]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/homebase-defence", "type": "item", "id": 27533}

In the attack phase you choose the weapons to use, and the final phase, execution, sees all the action take place.\n\n**These aliens are fast though, so you'll need to predict where your enemies will move to, and shoot there.**\n\nYou also have a limited number of actions per round, so charging across the map may leave you vulnerable to attack!\n\nKilling two or more enemies in a single round will allow you to call down an airstrike on pre-designated tiles. Airstrikes are the key to quickly clearing levels.\n\nMake sure to distract your enemies with bait, as one hit will send  you straight to Alien Hell.\n\n#### How to play \n* Use the action selector on the right to choose what to do during this phase. You can perform multiple actions, though there is a global limit per turn.\n* Press \"End Phase\" to move to the next action phases. \n* During the Targeting phase, aim **where you expect enemies to be**, as they will move before you shoot.\n* Once you end the targeting phase, actions will resolve automatically.\n\n\n### Credits\n* Code: [FireSlash](http://twitter.com/fireslash)\n* Art: [kiririn51](http://twitter.com/kiririn51)\n* Music: [Zircon](http://zirconstudios.bandcamp.com/)\n\n[Unminified version (source)](http://dev.comeonandsl.am/dev/LD38/)\n\n# [Play](http://comeonandsl.am/dev/LD38/)\n", "love": 0, "name": "STEEL GEAR CHAOS", "parent": 9405, "author": 25, "superparent": 9, "created": "2017-04-25T01:21:08Z", "meta": [], "modified": "2017-04-25T02:36:36Z", "slug": "steel-gear-chaos", "subtype": "game", "subsubtype": "jam", "version": 62536, "parents": [1, 5, 9, 9405], "notes": 0, "published": "2017-04-25T01:50:54Z", "link": {"author": [25, 17469]}, "path": "/events/ludum-dare/38/steel-gear-chaos", "type": "item", "id": 27749}

I made a **bugfix release** on Tuesday, April 25, at 09:50 Pacific time.\n\n- The spaceship should not be stopped by hitting you or a fish.  Whoops!  Slightly game-breaking.\n- Jumping on a steep slope should not launch you backwards.  This was really annoying and inadvertently inherited from another game.\n- The title screen now takes your keyboard layout into account when telling you the controls.  The controls are in the same _place_ on any keyboard, but the title screen assumed qwerty when telling you what they are, which could be rather confusing.\n- Fixed some typos in the shop menu.\n- Kerjiggered some numbers to make the game more fun.  We didn't have a lot of time to test, so it was a little unbalanced, which I argue is a bug.\n\nAlso, some people see a moon that's _much_ lower-resolution than intended.

The corporations have also discovered that pests can be a resource, instead of just a... \"nuisance\". So they have decided to start a zoo.\n\nGoal:\n\nYour goal is to keep attendance high. Attendees will show up in droves if you have a lot of critters they can look at, but will quickly bail if it turns into an infestation.\n\nGameplay:\n\nPests naturally flock together. Use your robot lokators to distract pests and guide them around the planetoid instead. But beware, if pests have nothing to do, they will likely relieve their boredom with some good ol' procreation.\n\nHaving enough pests will drive up attendee numbers. Having too many pests will drop them instead. You get points for maintaining attendance. The game is over when you no longer draw any attendees.\n\nControls:\n\n* Press the space bar to orbital drop a lokator. You can have a maximum of ten lokators, but keep in mind that they negatively affect attendee levels.\n* Select a lokator with left mouse button and move it around with the same left mouse button. Clicking outside the planetoid will deselect the selected lokator.\n* Hold down right mouse button to rotate the camera around the planetoid.\n* Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out on the planetoid.\n* Press Escape or P to pause the game and bring up the pause menu.\n* You can always directly quit the game with Alt-F4.\n\nEcho Team:\n\n* Art & Concept: Lauren Herda\n* Code & Concept: Berend Wouda\n* Music & Bunnies: Nathan van Ofwegen\n\nLinks:\n\n* Windows: http://www.echoteam.org\n* Source: https://github.com/LDEchoTeam/ld38/\n\n*It appears you can only use 2048 characters in a game description.
